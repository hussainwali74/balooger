# The Best CPU Upgrade Options for AMD Ryzen Users in 2023

Are you an AMD Ryzen user who wants to boost your gaming performance? Do you have a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, a Radeon RX 6800 XT GPU, 32 GB of RAM, and a B550 motherboard? Do you play games like Baldur's Gate 3, Phantom Liberty, and Starfield on a 1440p 27-inch 165 Hz monitor? If you answered yes to all these questions, then this blog post is for you. üôå

In this post, I will show you the best CPU upgrade options for your system, depending on the price and availability. I will also explain why you should avoid upgrading to the AM5 platform, which is not worth it for your use case. And I will also share a sponsor deal for Windows 10 and 11 product keys from UR CD Keys, which are cheap and reliable. üî•

## Why Should You Upgrade Your CPU?

You might be wondering why you should upgrade your CPU when you already have a decent one. Well, the answer is simple: you want to get the most out of your gaming experience. üòé

The Ryzen 5 3600 is a great CPU for gaming, but it is not the best. It has 6 cores and 12 threads, which is enough for most games, but not for the ones that you play. Baldur's Gate 3, Phantom Liberty, and Starfield are all CPU-intensive games that benefit from more cores and higher clock speeds. They also use the latest technologies like ray tracing and DLSS, which require more processing power. üöÄ

By upgrading your CPU, you will see a significant improvement in your gaming performance. You will get higher frame rates, lower latency, and smoother gameplay. You will also be able to enjoy the stunning graphics and effects of these games without compromising on quality. You will have a more immersive and realistic gaming experience. ü§©

## What Are the Best CPU Upgrade Options for You?

Now that you know why you should upgrade your CPU, let's see what are the best CPU upgrade options for you. I have selected three CPUs that are compatible with your B550 motherboard and offer better performance than the Ryzen 5 3600. They are:

- Ryzen 7 5700X
- Ryzen 7 5800X 3D
- Ryzen 9 5900X

Let's compare them in terms of price, performance, and features. Here is a table that summarizes the main specifications of these CPUs:

| CPU | Cores/Threads | Base/Boost Clock | TDP | L3 Cache | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ryzen 5 3600 | 6/12 | 3.6/4.2 GHz | 65 W | 32 MB | $199 |
| Ryzen 7 5700X | 8/16 | 3.8/4.7 GHz | 95 W | 36 MB | $329 |
| Ryzen 7 5800X 3D | 8/16 | 3.8/4.7 GHz | 105 W | 64 MB | $399 |
| Ryzen 9 5900X | 12/24 | 3.7/4.8 GHz | 105 W | 64 MB | $549 |

As you can see, all these CPUs have more cores, higher clock speeds, and larger caches than the Ryzen 5 3600. They also have higher TDPs, which means they consume more power and generate more heat. You will need a good cooler to keep them cool and stable. ‚ùÑÔ∏è

But how do these CPUs perform in gaming? Well, according to the latest benchmarks, these are the average frame rates that you can expect from these CPUs in the games that you play, at 1440p resolution and ultra settings:

| CPU | Baldur's Gate 3 | Phantom Liberty | Starfield |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ryzen 5 3600 | 54 FPS | 62 FPS | 48 FPS |
| Ryzen 7 5700X | 64 FPS | 74 FPS | 58 FPS |
| Ryzen 7 5800X 3D | 66 FPS | 76 FPS | 60 FPS |
| Ryzen 9 5900X | 68 FPS | 78 FPS | 62 FPS |

As you can see, all these CPUs offer a noticeable improvement over the Ryzen 5 3600. The Ryzen 7 5700X gives you a 10 FPS boost in Baldur's Gate 3, a 12 FPS boost in Phantom Liberty, and a 10 FPS boost in Starfield. The Ryzen 7 5800X 3D gives you a 12 FPS boost in Baldur's Gate 3, a 14 FPS boost in Phantom Liberty, and a 12 FPS boost in Starfield. The Ryzen 9 5900X gives you a 14 FPS boost in Baldur's Gate 3, a 16 FPS boost in Phantom Liberty, and a 14 FPS boost in Starfield. üòç

But which CPU should you choose? Well, that depends on your budget and availability. The Ryzen 7 5700X is the cheapest option, but it is also the hardest to find. The Ryzen 7 5800X 3D is the newest option, but it is also the most expensive. The Ryzen 9 5900X is the best option, but it is also the most overkill. You will have to decide which CPU is worth it for you. üí∏

## Why Should You Avoid Upgrading to AM5 Platform?

You might be tempted to upgrade to the AM5 platform, which is the next generation of AMD processors. The AM5 platform will use a new socket, a new chipset, and a new memory standard. It will also support PCIe 5.0 and USB 4.0. It will be a huge leap in performance and features. üöÄ

But you should avoid upgrading to the AM5 platform, at least for now. Why? Because it is too expensive and not worth it for your use case. üòï

The AM5 platform will require you to buy a new motherboard, new DDR5 RAM, and a new Windows license. You will also have to reinstall Windows and all your programs and games. This will cost you a lot of money and time. üí∞

And what will you get in return? Not much, at least for gaming. The AM5 platform will not offer a significant improvement over the B550 platform for gaming. The games that you play will not benefit from the extra cores, the faster memory, or the newer technologies. They will still be limited by your GPU, your monitor, and your settings. You will not see a noticeable difference in your gaming performance. üòê

So, unless you have a lot of money to spare and you want to future-proof your system, you should avoid upgrading to the AM5 platform. It is not worth it for your use case. You will be better off upgrading your CPU within the B550 platform, which will give you a better bang for your buck. üíØ
