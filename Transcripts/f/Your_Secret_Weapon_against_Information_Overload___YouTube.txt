Your_Secret_Weapon_against_Information_Overload___YouTube
 
one of the biggest challenges of Modern Life is information overload from messages meeting invites notifications documents that people are sending us plus the content we like to consume books podcasts YouTube videos those are all information too and sometimes you just feel stuck and you don't know why it's this feeling that you can't find what you're looking for even though you know you saved it if you ever have that experience I'm here to tell you it's not your fault you're trying to lead a modern 21st century life with a Paleolithic brain that did not evolve for that you can stay but I'm leaving so we turn to our digital productivity apps to carry some of the load in this video I'm talking about my action reference framework it's a simple way to put every piece of information exactly where it goes think about your second brain which is what I call my digital system for managing information think about it in terms of two hemispheres just as your biological brain processes information differently in the two hemispheres so does your digital brain on the left the more analytical side we have action things you have to do like tasks to-dos and meetings on the right the more free form creative side we have reference things you want to think about learn refer to and possibly incorporate into your work at some point in the future this distinction between actionable information and reference information originally comes from David Allen's book getting things done as information comes into your world the first decision you'll need to make is a simple yes no question is this something I need to do soon or not for example let's say a piece of information comes in which is file taxis is that something that you need to do in the short term or just something that you're keeping for future reference clearly something that you need to do it's an action so I'm going to put it on this side the actions that you need to take in your day-to-day life you don't want them to get lost in this sea of interesting stuff they need to be pulled out and put in a separate place where you give them more of your attention but remember I said there are two decisions you need to make for the action side the second question is does this action need to be taken at a specific time yes or no things like meetings Zoom calls events you're attending those can't happen whenever you feel like it they are highly time specific like 2: p.m. on a Tuesday so they should go in the perfect app design for that a calendar app I personally use Google Calendar a free service used by millions of people because it's completely reliable and allows me to send and receive meeting invites between myself and others but you also have the option of using a client calendar app that syncs with the Google Calendar servers now if an action doesn't need to happen at a specific specific time then it can go in your task manager which is a fancy name for a to-do list app I recommend starting with a free app like Apple's Reminders app or whatever comes built in on your devices I've used a task manager app called things for many years because it's beautifully designed super fast and responsive and makes it easy to save links to emails and websites but now let's take the example of say writing a personal essay that doesn't have an exact time that it needs to happen in and so I'm going to put it on the actionable side it is still an action you'll have to take but this one is going to go in your task manager we've talked about the action hemisphere now let's turn our attention to the other hemisphere which is the reference side once again we have two options the first one is a Notes app Notes apps are a place to store bits of digital content text images links the power of a digital Notes app is that it's casual you just dash off a thought or drop in a photo or paste a link without having to worry about exactly how it's formatted I think of my notes as a working environment like a studio or a laboratory when I sit down to work the first thing I do is open up my notes app because that is where I am actually doing the work but not everything can go in a notes stop there are a few kinds of content such as a PDF or a file that's too large or a shared document like a Google doc that should go in your general file storage instead so for example quote from a book first question is is it actionable or not it's not actionable and then between these two options is it something that needs to be maintained in its current format or is it very large not really so it can go in the notes app now let's take another example let's say you're doing some research and you save a useful PDF the content in PDFs often can't easily be turned into other formats definitely goes on the reference side but can't be turned into notes and so we'll keep it in file storage on something like Google Drive begin thinking about your productivity as a system it's something apart from yourself that you can step back and design and change when you start to feel that sense of information overload Rising instead of succumbing to it or thinking there's something wrong with you ask yourself a question what is going wrong in my system that is creating this feeling in other words it's not you it's your system if you're wondering how to organize these different parts of your second brain which is where a lot of people struggle that's why I created perah perah cuts across all four of these systems giving you a single way to organize all information regardless of where it's located check out our Paris series to learn more I personally use Google Google gole Google [Music] Google Okay I'm learning I'm learning just as your biological brain process processes Pro processes I recommend you start using the free Google
