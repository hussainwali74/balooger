i've completed a lot of projects in my life i wrote a book i have launched a course i've traveled the world started a family so i've learned a lot about how to finish what i start but for this video i'm going to throw all of that out the window here are the top eight most effective ways to self sabotage your efforts if you follow these steps closely i can guarantee you will stall out your projects you'll spin your wheels and wonder what the heck you have to show after days or weeks or even months of hard effort are you ready first always start new things completely from scratch don't think about the past don't look at any existing material that you might have access to or anything you've learned or discovered in life nope insist that everything you do be 100 original start every piece of writing with a clean white page and use only the ideas that you can come up with right in that moment especially avoid studying existing experts or old masters who you might be able to learn from second try to feel guilty it's important as you begin creating plans and routines in your life that your background emotional state is one of guilt think about ruminate on all the times you've failed in the past convince yourself that you will inevitably fail in the very same ways in the future if possible this is an advanced technique turn that guilt into shame which is even more effective at keeping you stuck next you must insist on perfection in everything you do assume that there will be immediate catastrophic consequences on your life if you make even the smallest mistake don't allow one typo broken link unfinished sentence or half-formed thought to form in your mind much less appear in your work tell yourself that avoiding all mistakes is the only path to success wait to take any action until a successful outcome is 100 assured fourth do all the research first the internet is full of interesting content so you had better consume all the available advice from every random person on the internet before you take the first step right by doing all this research up front you can tell yourself that you're making progress when secretly you're procrastinating on the real world learning that would actually make a difference doing research is the perfect excuse to avoid anything that takes you past your comfort zone and you know what if all else fails try to get yourself mired in ever more complex debates about the correct tagging system or organizing system which we know never lead anywhere go big whatever you take on make sure it is the grandest most ambitious endeavor anyone has ever conceived of it's best to think of your goals as these awe-inspiring feats the likes of which humanity has never witnessed by going big from the very start and also committing to it forever you create this rush of excitement that sends you into a flurry of activity without too much reflection or any kind of strategy you can tell everyone you know about your grand plans thereby getting most of the emotional payoff of accomplishment without having to actually achieve anything it's awesome to maximize your chance of failure do things completely by yourself don't talk to anyone don't ask for advice don't seek out teachers or mentors and definitely above all do not get feedback on your ideas at an early stage doing it all by yourself ensures that you continue doing things just the way you've always done them even if a new project demands a completely new approach best of all working in secret means that you only ever have access to your own ideas your own imagination your own life experience and thus can never really create anything different from what you've created before now try to compare yourself with others as much as you possibly can ideally choose people who are the most successful impressive performers in their field highlight their best qualities while excusing their worst and then do the opposite for yourself definitely never consider let's say learning from them or using them as inspiration it's much more effective if you think of them as a competitor or a rival that you have to beat and finally step 8 possibly the most important postpone gratification i want you to strenuously avoid any kind of pleasure or joy and assume that any positive feeling will just make you lazy and extinguish your motivation listen closely and really believe that inner critic in your head that is constantly telling you that you don't deserve fulfillment you don't deserve to celebrate small wins and you know what no one notices or cares anyway pleasure and fun are what make any effort sustainable for the long term and we know that all results come from consistency over the long term so make sure you don't enjoy any part of the journey by following these steps i can virtually guarantee that you will never accomplish your creative dreams for more insight on how to avoid accomplishing your most important goals make sure to avoid building
