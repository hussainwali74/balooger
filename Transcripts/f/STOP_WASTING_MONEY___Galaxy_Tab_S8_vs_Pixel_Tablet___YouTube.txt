- There are a lot of similarities between the Pixel tablet and the Samsung tab S8, but at the same time, there are also some super important differences. The Pixel tablet marks Google long awaited return to the tablet space, but how does it measure up to an entry level flagship Android tablet from Samsung? Well, you'll see, and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. In the US the tab S8 sells for 599 and the Pixel tablet for 499. Obviously, they come with different accessories, but they're still in the same price category. Also, I know the prices are very different around the world, so if you're watching this video from outside of the US, please let me know in the comments section where you're from and what each tablet costs? Now, starting out with the displays, both tablets have fully laminated 11 inch LCD displays, so there's no air gap. Both have a resolution of 2560 by 1600, an aspect ratio of 16 by 10, and the Pixel has a slightly higher pixel density, no pun intended, but it's definitely not something that you'll notice during real life use. Now considering the price point, both tablets will work great for watching video, for playing games, for surfing the web and for social media. Looking at them side by side the tab S8 display is definitely warmer in terms of color temperature, and the Pixel tablet seems more true to life. Now since we're getting the same aspect ratio, you'll have similarly sized black bars at the top and the bottom when you're watching video, but the tab S8 does have slightly smaller bezels. Now another area where the tab S8 comes out ahead is refresh rate. The Pixel tablet is locked at 60 hertz whereas the tab S8 gives you the option for 60 hertz or an adaptive 120 hertz. This option will automatically increase the refresh rate whenever it's needed for smoother animation and scrolling. I have lots of tablets that only have 60 hertz and have other tablets that have 120 hertz, so I've used both, for me, 60 hertz is not a deal breaker, but given the choice I would prefer 120 hertz. If you're looking for a higher end display then Samsung does offer the larger tab S8+ or the even bigger tab S8 ultra both of which come with an incredible super AMOLED display. But what if you're on the go? You want a two display setup and you want a desktop operating system? That brings me to today's sponsor Best Buy, and the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. It's the ultimate portable productivity powerhouse with not just one but two 2.8K OLD displays. You can use it like a traditional laptop with either a virtual track pad and keyboard or with the included Bluetooth keyboard, and when you wanna take things to the next level just pop open the stand, you get an extremely versatile dual display set up anywhere you go. The Yoga Book 9i comes with Windows 11 home which makes it easier to be productive. All my office apps work great, I installed Adobe Creative Cloud and I really like the snap layouts and the multiple desktops. You'll be more productive with multiple apps open at the same time. You can use the displays in vertical or horizontal orientation. You can switch over to tablet mode and use the included stylus, and switching between modes is super easy. You can even use tent mode which is great for presentations where your audience sees the actual presentation while you still have the presenter's screen on your side. So, if you're ready to improve your productivity, check out the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i at Best Buy. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now, even though the Pixel tablet and the tab S8 are very similar in size, they're quite different in their approach to design. The tab S8 has your typical modern tablet design with machined aluminum on the squared off sides and the back. The Pixel tablet has a much softer approach with rounded edges and a nano ceramic coating which feels nice to hold and does a great job at rejecting fingerprints. The build quality seems to be pretty good on both tablets and they both feel very solid in the hand, and I haven't had any issues with bending. Now looking around the edges, we see four speaker grills and four speakers, in both cases. If you're making a decision based on audio quality, the tab S8 gets much louder, and at the same time it sounds a bit fuller, richer, and provides a better overall sound stage. Now both tablets have a USB C port for charging and for connecting accessories. And in an addition to volume controls, both tablets offer fingerprint sensors integrated into the power buttons. For biometric authentication, the tab S8 also gives you the option of using facial recognition with the front facing camera, it's less secured than the fingerprint sensor, but it's more convenient, so you get to choose whichever option is right for you. Now, a major advantage of the tab S8 is that it has a micro SD cart slot which lets you expand the internal storage by up to one terabyte. That means that you can relatively inexpensively add a lot of internal storage space, and you can use this additional space for files and for apps. Now, not every app will give you the option of moving to the micro SD card, but the majority of the apps and games that I tried to move worked, and then they continue to run smoothly from the card, and we'll come back to this in the configuration section because it could be very important to some users. Now, let's talk about what's included and the available accessories. So, the Pixel tablet comes with a charging speaker dock which separately sells for $129. It charges the tablet wirelessly, which is really convenient and I wish all my tablets had something like that. It also raises the Pixel tablet off your desk while positioning it in a comfortable angle for viewing and it acts as a speaker when the tablet is docked so you're getting better audio performance. It can also replace a Nest Hub Max when the Pixel tablet is docked, so keep that in mind if you're considering buying the hub. When the Pixel tablet is docked, it goes into hub mode, where you can use it to control your smart home or have it showcase your favorite photos or a collection of artwork, both of which are really nice options because typically when I'm not using my tablets, they're just laying around doing nothing. It also means that the tablet is pretty much always charged and ready to go. Now the tab S8 comes with an S pen and a USB C charging cable. The S pen can be charged on the back of the tablet and it can be stored on the back or the top. It's a Bluetooth enabled stylist, so you can do things like remotely control the camera and media playback. Now the S pen only needs to be charged for the wireless functions. For writing, for taking notes or for navigating around the UI, it'll work even without a charge. There's no first party stylus from Google, but the Pixel tablet is compatible with USI 2.0 stylus pens. The one that I've been using cost me 60 bucks and it works quite well. If you want to be even more productive and you're looking for a keyboard case then that's an easy win for the tab S8. The Pixel tablet currently has no keyboard case from Google, and I would guess that there'll be some third party options on the market very soon. For the tab S8, there are two options from Samsung both protect the tablet and the S pen, so it comes down to which design you prefer, and of course both tablets work great with external keyboards. Now looking at the camera systems, the Pixel tablet has an 8 megaPixel, 1080p front facing camera versus a 13 megaPixel 4K camera on the tab S8. Now moving on to the back of the tablets, the tab S8 has a dual camera system with a 13 megaPixel wide camera, and a 6 megaPixel ultra wide versus a single 8 megaPixel camera on the Pixel tablet. I mostly use the cameras on my tablets for video calls and for scanning documents, so, this isn't really a deciding factor for me, and here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the Pixel tablet and the tab S8. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect from each tablet. Now, let's quickly discuss performance where we'll talk both about benchmarks and real life use. So, the tab S8 comes with the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip versus the Tensor G2 on the Pixel tablet. Now both are offered 128 and 256 gigabyte options and both come with 8 gigs of RAM. Now, if you're interested in benchmarks we're getting very similar single and multi-core performance. The tab S8 comes out well ahead in GPU performance, and keep in mind that the tab S8 was released about 14 months before the Pixel tablet. There's probably a newer and more powerful version coming very soon. But you're most likely curious about day-to-day use when you're just browsing the web, using various productivity apps, playing games or multitasking. How do these tablets compare there? Overall, given the price opening apps, switching between apps and working with multiple apps, it's fast on the newer Pixel tablet and on the tab S8 even though it's quite a bit older. Where we start seeing some meaningful differences is with multitasking. The Pixel has pretty basic multitasking capabilities. You can run two apps side by side, and there's a convenient dock which gives you access to recently used apps. The tab S8 with the latest one UI, which is one of my favorite Android interfaces, lets you run three tiled apps at the same time, you can have pop-up windows. The Edge panel gives you super quick access to additional apps and save layouts, and then there's Dex. Now if you want more of a laptop or a desktop like experience Dex essentially reboots the tablet with an OS that looks very similar to what you get with a laptop. You've got a task bar where you can minimize and see active apps. You have an actual desktop with icon and you can run multiple floating windows or snap windows to the sides of the display. If you happen to have an external monitor, keyboard and mouse, you can connect all three of them and then run a dual display setup with full external monitor use without black bars. You can also use the tab S8 as an external display for your laptop or desktop with Samsung's second screen feature. All in all, the Pixel tablet will work great for some light multitasking, but the tab S8 is much more versatile and capable in that regard. Of both tablets have access to a ton of Android apps. The Samsung notes is one of my favorite note taking apps, so I love having it on the tab S8. On the Pixel, I love using the recorder app. Google apps are really well optimized for the Pixel tablet, and I also like the features that are integrated into the camera app, not so much the camera itself because again, I don't really use it for photos or video, but features like Magic Eraser which allow me to remove unwanted elements from photos that I've already taken. And when it comes to long-term operating system support, the Pixel tablet offers at least three years of software updates and five years of security updates. Samsung is promising four years of OS updates and five years of security updates, and keep in mind when each tablet was released. In terms of battery life, it's a little challenging to compare because I've had the tab S8 since the day was released and I've only had the Pixel tablet for about a month. Now when I compared the notes that I have from when the tab S8 was new, I was getting about 12 to 14 hours versus the Pixel tablet which is rated for 12 hours and probably gives me pretty close to that for everyday use. I have to say that the dock makes a big practical difference to me because almost every time when I'm not using the Pixel tablet, I just place it on the dock and then it's always charging, whereas with the tab S8 and every other tablet that I own, I sometimes forget to plug it in and I know, I know that's really on me, it's not the fault of the tablet. On a typical day when I'm not spending hours editing and rendering video or playing games, I have no problems getting through a full day on a single charge with either tablet. Now, if I'm going to relax for a few hours and game then both tablets are gonna need to be charged at some point and that's something that I expect with any mobile device. Now, in terms of actual gameplay, both chips are powerful enough for the games that I play. Genshin Impact was playable on both devices, but definitely performed better on the tab S8. Now, keep in mind that the tab S8 also has 120 Hertz display and while I always use headphones when I'm playing, if you don't, the tab S8 also has better speakers. I always asked about options for PUBG settings and with both tablets I can go to HDR for graphics, if I want extreme frame rate, and ultra HD graphics with ultra for frame rates. Now both tablets also performed quite well when they're paired with an Xbox controller and then used to stream games with Xbox Game Pass. I played all of my typical games and since displays are about the same size, I wouldn't really give either one the definitive edge as long as I had a strong internet connection both tablets absolutely crushed every game that I played and I didn't have any issues. When we look at configuration options and pricing, we see a very important difference. I'm going to use the prices off of the Google and Samsung stores because they're more standardized, but you can usually find better prices by using the links in the description. Now both tablets are available with 128 and 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 8 gigs of RAM, but the Pixel tablet is wifi only, and the tab S8 is available in a 5G version. And remember that you can add a lot more storage to the tab S8 with a micro SD card. So here's how I would choose, if you want a less expensive tablet with a super useful charging speaker dock, dual functionality as a smart hub, you want basic and simple multitasking, and you like the look and feel of the nano ceramic coating, get a Pixel tablet. Overall, the tab S8 has a lot of advantages when it comes to productivity and multitasking, has a better camera system, better speakers. It comes included with a powerful stylist. It offers facial recognition, expandable internal storage, and it's available in a 5G version. Now you should see how the Pixel tablet compares with the iPad 10. Hopefully this video was helpful.
