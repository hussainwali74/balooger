Final_Cut_Pro_on_iPad_is_AMAZING____YouTube
 
[Music] it's finally here Final Cut on iPad is now officially out and this is the real deal this is a fully brand new version of Final Cut Pro for the iPad completely redesigned from the ground up and I couldn't be more excited for the iPad in general and I've also been super lucky Apple invited me up to their offices in London to check it out early to ask some questions and since then I've been using it for the past three or four days or so and I wanted to give you my first kind of early Impressions and some overall thoughts on it so without any further Ado let's jump straight into this video let's start with my upfront thoughts because there really is a lot to dig into but overall I couldn't be happier of how this kind of Final Cut has turned out they haven't just taken Final Cut on Mac and plopped it onto the iPad this is a completely rebuilt version designed with touch in mind and it's got loads of new features which are really cool and really interesting which are kind of iPad specific and it's all also got some differences from the Mac version 2. this isn't some watered-down version of Final Cut Pro either pretty much everything you want from Final Cut is here and what I will say is if this is your first time using Final Cut Pro or any kind of more advanced video editing software you're probably going to really like this version because it's quite simple and friendly to get into and there's not loads of stuff going on everywhere which sometimes can be overwhelming when you open one of these more kind of professional apps but overall yeah this is great I think you're gonna love it okay looking into it in a bit more detail now there's absolutely everything here in terms of editing that you need on Final Cut and if you're coming from the Mac version of Final Cut everything on this iPad version is going to make sense pretty quickly there's everything you need to edit to add text to do transitions to do video effects all of that stuff it's all here on the iPad and there's no kind of weird baked down version of it it's pretty much all as you'd expect it to be which is fantastic but it is all completely rejigged into this Touch first interface and it works just how you'd expect it to once you start zooming around pinching to zoom in pinching to zoom out dragging Clips on re-editing Clips with your finger it all makes a lot of sense really quickly there is full support for the iPad keyboard as well so all of the keyboard shortcuts that you're used to pretty much all work exactly the same there are some differences there but with the Apple magic keyboard it works really nicely together and if you're more used to that keyboard and trackpad experience then you can do that here which is great and it's nice and fast too I'm using heavily compressed Sony h.265 footage in this project and scrubbing and playing back and all of those things is absolutely perfect on here it's very comparable to my Mac Studio but I do have the M2 iPad Pro here which obviously has a bit more grunt than everything else and on that note you do need an iPad with an M series chip so you need an M1 or an M2 to run Final Cut Pro and if you don't have that unfortunately it's just not going to work and while I think that is a shame and it really is a shame I imagine it's tied to the media engine and the Ram size which is present on the M series chips which the other ones just don't have so everything you need to kind of edit a video is there but there's some really cool iPad specific features and I wanted to go over some of my favorite ones because some of these are just so awesome first off is the jog wheel this sits on the right hand side it's one quick tap away and when you rotate this it lets you move through your project one frame at a time so you can make those really specific edits which you usually make with a mouse or something similar on a Mac you can also use the apple pencil for some really fine controllers though if you need to be really specific and if you've got an M2 iPad then you can actually hover over your timeline and highlight things and see what they're going to do before you put your pencil on the iPad which is really cool as well really really useful for scrubbing thirdly is one called live drawing which is something I was really excited about but effectively what this does is it lets you draw over your video in real time and Final Cut will animate your drawing and you can use the pencil for this but you can also use your finger if you don't have one and that's really useful I can imagine it's going to let me highlight things or let me point at stuff very directly in a video and that's something I've wanted to do for a long time so I'm really excited to start using that another really powerful feature which is really really cool as well is the background removal tool this basically just lets you add a green screen effect to pretty much anything so you can cut people out of a frame and put text behind them or change the background the cutout is very similar to what you'd get on an iPhone you do portrait mode so it's never quite perfect but it's really good if you're just doing a super quick edit or if you've got a nice clean background you can make the effect really stand out and I think it's really really nice next up is if you use some of the music from Apple's Library so there's a huge library of Music in here if you drag that on you get about three minutes of a song but if you continually drag the track it just re-jigs the song So it Carries On On and On which is really useful because whenever I make a video and I'm sure a lot of you out there we have to find a very specific way to Loop a song or to match beats up so you can keep the song going for like 10 minutes rather than three and on this you can literally just drag it straight out which is awesome unfortunately it does only work with Apple's media library which is pretty big which is cool but if you drag in any of your own songs it won't work for those only the ones which are built in you can also film directly into Final Cut as well so if for some reason you've forgotten to get a shot and you really don't have any time you can just hit the camera button film straight on your iPad with a bit more finer control as well you actually get white balance control on the camera and focus control which is really cool and then you can film that and it will plunk it straight into your final cut project and you can plop it straight into the timeline immediately you'd have to be in a pretty big pinch to do that I think but it's a cool feature regardless and finally if you want to you can take your project from Final Cut on the iPad and then export it and start editing it on the Mac as well and then bring that back to iPad if you want to which is really really useful if you're across two systems so yeah there's loads of new updates here I've just picked some of my favorite ones there's a bunch of other stuff as well but yeah some really cool stuff here and I'm really excited to start using it properly so that's enough talking about what it can do and I wanted to talk now about the things it can't do and some limitations because there are some but bear in mind this is an ongoing thing so I think a lot of this will get updated and features will change over time but first up there's no custom Lut support right now so if you want to color grade you can normally by using all the stuff inside but as for custom Luts that's not here yet which is a bit of a shame and along with that a third-party plug-in support isn't here yet but that is coming what I don't know is if that's going to have to be iPad specific as opposed to what you can just use on the Mac you can't work off external drives yet so everything you import into the project stays on the iPad and stays all in one file and then you have to take that around with you if you want to and these last two which I thought were quite strange on the media bin file there's no way of making files right now it's just filters and you have to name everything of keywords to kind of get through your footage which isn't too difficult but just having a file system seems a lot more easy and a lot of other apps do that I'm not sure why that's not here and lastly and this is one of the stranger ones I thought was there's no external want to support for this at all so if you plug your iPad into your external monitor you won't get a full kind of desktop experience which I initially thought was a bit of a shame but with all of the effort they put into the touch interface I can kind of see why they want to just keep you on the iPad at the moment while I was listing off the kind of limitations in that I had kind of this overarching thought and I think I wasn't really trying to convince us to move away from our desktops so if you're like a final cut user or a Premiere Pro user or a DaVinci Resolve user on your Mac or your PC or whatever this isn't designed to kind of bring you over and make sure you use that the idea is is this is just a different version of Final Cut for different people like I said at the start of this video if you've never used it before I think this version of Final Cut Pro is going to make a lot more sense to a lot more people it's a lot more approachable all the tools are there and if you want to kind of graduate if you will into Final Cut on the Mac then you've got this really amazing leaping off point I very much think the idea here was to have an all-in-one studio in the palm of your hand on your iPad where you can do it all and it's not made to convince people like me to switch over to it it's just a different version of Final Cut Pro for different users and I think that's a really good thing obviously nothing's perfect I have some wishlist features for this I wish I hope come eventually and first off has to be external monitor support I think having the iPad there for use for final control to control everything and then just having a big player on my external monitor would be really cool so I hope Sunday that comes I really hope custom Lut support comes I know that will be a barrier for quite a lot of people so getting that in there would be really great and finally I'd really like to see proper external drive support that would be awesome because someone like me gets through hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes of video footage every other day then having it all on the iPad doesn't make a lot of sense for someone like me but overall I'm pretty stoked on this you can probably tell this is a really really cool version of Final Cut Pro and I'm so excited for people to start using it and for myself to really get into it and use those iPad specific features this is just a cool update and I'm really excited because it means the future of iPad is looking good they put out logic pro as well recently which looks fantastic two and with things like DaVinci Resolve on the iPad more and more stuff's coming over and for me it's all gravy before we go I did want to talk about the pricing structure for Final Cut because this is now 4.99 a month or 50 pounds for the year which is a bit of a departure for apps like this from Apple Final Cut has kind of always been a one-time purchase thing you pay 300 pounds and that's it for life which is still quite high and in my eyes when I was a student I know that buying something that expensive just kind of wasn't possible but getting sang at 4.99 a month would be possible so I'm in two minds about this I love that it's more available for a lot more people but I don't love that the price could potentially go on for forever and ever but let me know what you think about in that in the comments below because I'd love to know what your opinions are on that one and that pretty much rounds up this video to be honest that's an early look at Final Cut I hope you enjoyed it if you've got any questions ask me in the comments below as well and I'll potentially make a few more videos on Final Cut too so if there's something you want to see let me know and I will see you all in the next one if you want
