(soft music) - So, this is the new Pixel tablet from Google and it's one of the products that I'm most excited about this year. And it's not just because I love tablets and I use them every day. It's mostly because for years I've been asking, "Why isn't Google releasing a tablet?" And even at this year's CES, I walked around the Google display and saw Android in cars, different types of hubs, music, fitness, then integrations with so many different types of devices and I just felt like something was missing. Well, I've had a chance to play around with this pre-release version of the Pixel tablet for a couple of weeks now. It sells for $499 but it does come with an accessory that I haven't had included on any other tablet that I own so far, and I have some thoughts to share. So, as far as the design, we're getting an 11 inch tablet with rounded corners and edges. The frame and the back are both aluminum, but then there's this nano ceramic coating that feels really nice in the hand. It's smooth, but at the same time it's not slippery, and the porcelain color that I got seems to do a pretty good job at rejecting fingerprints. The pixel tablet is also available on two other colors, rose, which just like my porcelain, has white bezels and then hazel, which comes with black bezels. Now, looking around the edges we see four speakers, three microphones, a USBC port for charging and connecting accessories, volume controls and a power button with an integrated fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication. Now, this particular sensor has been super responsive and accurate for me so far, and I like the fact that you don't have to wake the tablet from sleep first. You just place your finger on the sensor and the tablet will wake and unlock. Google also added two slim rubber feet to the bottom of the long edge of the tablet and that way if you have it leaning against something it won't come sliding down and crash on your desk. And that's a really nice touch. I appreciate that. Now, let's talk about the display. It's an 11 inch 60 hertz LCD display, with support for 16.7 million colors. It has a resolution of 2560 by 1600, 500 NITS brightness, a pixel density of 276 and support for HDR10. Now, overall the image quality is very good for a tablet at this price point. The display is sharp, the images look crisp and you can select between natural colors or adaptive, which seems to add saturation and has a more vibrant feel. Now, the 16 by 10 aspect ratio is great for when you're watching content because you're getting smaller letter boxing or black bars on the top and the bottom. The anti smudge coating did a relatively good job and this tablet does offer support for USI 2.0 Stylus pens. So, to put this display in context, I think it's a good value for the money. It's not a high end OLED or Liquid Retina XDR display. We're not getting 120 hertz, but we're also nowhere near that price point, which brings me to the included charging speaker dock. For $499, you get the Pixel tablet and then this surprisingly useful dock, which independently sells for $129 and that puts the Pixel tablet at $370. Now, there are two ways to look at this. If you're saying, "Hey, I wasn't planning on buying a dock "and now I'm paying for an accessory that I don't need, "and I wish I could just buy the tablet for $370." Now, I think that's a fair perspective. At the same time, if you're buying this tablet it's very likely that you already invested in other Google products and this combination could also replace a Next Hub Max, which typically sells for $229 and right now is on sale for 189. Now, putting both those perspective on hold for just a moment, I think that this Doc offers some really practical advantages, some of which I thought about right away, but some of 'em were so subtle that I didn't realize until I actually started using it. Now, there are four power and data pins on the back of the Pixel tablets and they match up with the four pins on the dock. The magnetic connection to the dock is really strong. You do not need to worry about the tablet accidentally falling off the dock, or getting knocked off if you just bump it. If you just try to grab the tablet with one hand the tablet will actually lift the dock off the desk and in order to remove it with one hand, you kind of have to press down and then tilt it forward. The first thing that I like about this dock is that my Pixel tablet is always charging when it's docked. So, when I'm ready to go, it's fully charged. With every other tablet that I own, I have to plug it in. Now, obviously that's not the end of the world, but just like with my phone, it's more convenient to charge wirelessly and this dock offers 15 watt charging. The next advantage is that the Pixel tablet isn't laying flat on my desk, so it takes up less space and it's much less likely to have something get pushed on top of it and scratch the screen. Now, I'm not saying that I'm a messy person, I'm just saying that maybe my desk isn't always as clean as it looks in the videos. I also love the fact that the Pixel tablet is always facing me rather than being flat on the desk, so that way I can see alerts, I can watch movies and I can use it without needing to pick it up. Now also, when I'm watching movies or listening to music, the 43.5 millimeter full-range speaker on the dock, it's not just louder than the Pixel tablet, but the audio is fuller, it's warmer, it has significantly more base and it provides a much better audio experience. Now, another cool feature is that if I start watching a movie while I'm holding the Pixel tablet and then I place it on the dock, the audio seamlessly transitions over. Now, when the Pixel tablet is docked, it goes into hub mode and there it can act like a digital photo frame. It can show you Smart home controls and you can get hands-free help from Google Assistant. So, I can actually see myself getting two more docks and then end up with one in my office, one in the kitchen and one in the studio, and that way as I move around the house I always have an available doc and we actually do a lot of video calls from the kitchen, which brings me to the camera system. Now, to be fair, this is a pretty basic setup. We've got two eight megapixel cameras, one on the back and one on the front. Both offer 1080p 30 and I like that the one on the front is on the long edge, so I'm properly framed in the center when the Pixel tablet is docked. I also wanna mention that even as a camera nerd, I don't actually mind a more basic camera system on a tablet because I really only use it for video calls and for scanning documents. For everything else, I'm gonna go ahead and use my phone because it's lighter and more convenient. And here's a quick sample of the camera and microphone. Here's a quick test of the camera and microphone on the Pixel tablet. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio quality that you should expect. What's really cool is that you get camera features, like Magic Eraser and Photo on Blur with the tablet. So, for example, here's a night shot from one of my Pixel 7 Pro comparisons and I don't like the two blue cones in it. All I have to do is highlight them with the Magic Eraser and a couple of seconds later they're completely gone. Or this shot of Sophie that Mack had to rudely photo bomb, I just have to outline her and outta here. Alright, one last one, just to keep things fair, let's get Sophie's foot out of the shot of Mack. Super easy, just highlight it. Google takes care of the rest and it's a much cleaner image. Now, as far as the speakers, I would say that they're mid-tier. We're actually getting four speakers, instead of the two that we typically see with other tablets at this price, and that ends up generating pretty decent stereo sound. It's also great for gaming because you can detect where footsteps are coming from, but most of the time I end up wearing headphones when I play and I'll talk more about gaming in just a minute. As far as battery life, we're getting a 27 watt hour battery and I use this tablet a ton. I watch movies, I played games, I surfed the web. I also filmed a lot for this review and the battery life was really good. It's rated for 12 hours of video streaming, which actually puts it ahead of a lot of its competitors, and I have some more detailed comparisons coming soon. I already talked about charging using the dock. You can also use the USBC port and keep in mind that there's no USBC charger or a USBC cable in the box. You get the pixel tablet, the charging speaker dock and the power adapter for the dock, which is not USBC. I have cables all over the place, but I gotta tell you that I didn't use them with this tablet even once because every time I was at my desk it went back on the dock. Now, one of the areas where you'll definitely appreciate the battery life is gaming and the Pixel tablet has eight gigabytes of ram and it's powered by the Tensor G2 chip. It's the same chip that we saw on the Pixel 7 lineup. It's not a chip that's really designed to perform super well in benchmark apps, and I couldn't actually get Geek Bench 6 to install on the Pixel tablet, but I'll try to get updated results in my long-term Pixel tablet review. Now, I do have to say that the Tensor G2 is specifically designed for what Google wants you to get out of their devices and that includes a lot of software features, like all the Smart functionality and things like the camera features that I showed you. Now, the gaming experience on the Pixel tablet has been pretty good and depends on what game I was playing. Asphalt ran really smoothly and it looked fantastic. PUBG also worked very well and I could go up to HDR for graphics and extreme for frame rate, or ultra HD for graphics and ultra for framing. Now, I typically play on smooth and balanced for graphics and then extreme for frame rate and that way I get smooth gameplay and good battery life. Now, when playing Genshin, I could play even with graphics set to high, which is pretty good, and that was overclocking a chip to the max, but still provided a fairly good gameplay experience. I also paired an Xbox controller and then streamed games using the Xbox Game Pass app and I was easily able to play any of the games that I typically play as long as I had a solid internet connection. Now, speaking of connectivity, we're getting Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. For storage, we're looking at 128 gigabytes, which is what you get for 499 and you can double that to 256 for an additional a hundred bucks. Well, I like that Google didn't start with 64 gigabytes, it's 2023 and even with just a couple of big games, you're quickly gonna run out of storage if you only have 64 gigs, and I think that the upcharge of a hundred dollars for an additional 128 gigs is reasonable. I was also super happy that we're getting at least five years of Pixel updates, so that's security and software updates and this way we should be good to go until at least June, 2028. And I really love seeing Google push this beyond what other Android tablets offer and it's something that I mentioned in my Pixel 7A review, which you should check out. I'm really excited to see that Google is getting back in the tablet game. I think that they could do a ton of super interesting stuff in this space, and I hope that the Pixel tablet is just an early sign of what's to come. Now, you should check out this comparison.
