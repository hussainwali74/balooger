Folders_are_dead__Inside_Anne_Laure_s_Second_Brain___YouTube
 
there was an article recently college students today don't know what folders are the professor says oh go to this folder what's a folder a whole generation coming up now that grew up with Google I haven't used folders on my laptop for probably 10 years that whole Paradigm is going to pass away and Laura lecompte is the founder of Nest Labs an ex-google employee and a neuroscience PhD I've ridden about almost 5 no I don't know how you do that but anyway go on and she's built a digital note system to help her publish hundreds of Articles a year in order to be so prolific in terms of writing obviously I do need to capture a lot of information and then transform this into actual original ideas and Laura's second brain is built around two digital worlds Rome research and the Google Suite Rome is a folder-free note-taking app preferred by the Gardner archetype note takers who connect notes on the Fly whereas Google keep is used by the student archetype that favors ease of use and quick capture no matter where they are for the longest time I was using only Google products it's a proper Google fine girl so I would take my notes in Google Keep do all of my writing in Google Docs I would even book the time that I need to write in my Google calendar so everything everything would happen in Google but I am a believer in specific tools for specific jobs I think for note-taking there's nothing in the Google ecosystem that's doing a good job enough that you would find in other tools that roam in my case but there's other people using notion Evernote these are tools that are specifically designed for note-taking and Google hasn't built that yet a big struggle that I have and this is definitely a source of friction is that I actually love good old paper books it's something that I really enjoy and I don't want to sacrifice for more efficiency so it means that I'm very old-school with highlights I have a pen and I will just underline whatever I think is interesting and then I will do a little dark ear but at the bottom of the book and I tried then whenever I'm sitting down in front of my laptop and I'm going to take notes and do a little bit of more proactive research I will just go through all of the pages that I've read in the past day or two days and decide whether it's going to go in my note-taking system or not and I'll just type it up which is why very often for each book I don't end up with a lot of things I actually import because it's pretty tedious actually it's not fun that's not the fun part at all of note taking it's a good filter I think using friction as a friend not all friction is inherently bad some things you don't don't want to happen faster you don't want to have more of so friction can be you know like a helpful constraint friction as a friend I love that so if you come across the link that you don't have time to read immediately but you're like I want to get to to this later do you use a dedicated program do you save it in Rome what's your what's your workflow I see I sing wrong I actually coded my own little Web Clipper cool for Rome it's just in the bookmark bar click on this and it takes the information from the link it adds a to read tag the reason why I like having this tag is then that I can go here and my theory category and if I look at all of the references here it's a reading list it's a read later app inside of room because I often also add other tags to it to read and then another tag I can also then filter things and just pull things to read about a certain topic but that's cool so you're sort of like batch processing instead of having to switch to completely different subjects you just like one subject [Music] what do you do once you want to prioritize it create some sort of structure add order and meaning let's say to the information that you've captured for anyone who's been using computers you've been taught to use folders and subfolders where everything has a specific place and so if you want to find a note you'll have to think about okay what's the highest category that this belongs to and then I'm going to go to the correct subcategory and here is my note drill down one step at a time exactly what I like about Rome is that it's a lot more flexible once I've read something I'm just going to add tags which in Rome correspond to specific Pages which I treat like hubs basically so I have a hub for example that's all about EEG which is a technique that I use for my PhD whenever I read something about it whenever I take notes I'm going to add EEG to it and then it's going to show up here without you having to do anything or specifically take this action it makes it appear here automatically on a page which is just like a web page that is titled EEG is that right absolutely and by just adding this tag then this page is going to pull all of the notes that are linking back to this page so here for example if you look at the linked references you see all of the days where I randomly read stuff about EEG and I added a tag here so they're all showing up here there's nothing else to do for me and it's very similar to the way my reading list is working so you didn't have to create this page build this page design this page maintain this page all of that maintenance is kind of done for you it's freeing up mental energy for actual creative thinking and this is where we should spend our time and energy [Music] a lot of people think that coming up with new ideas is about having this mystical Eureka moment this Muse is whispering in your ear exactly it turns on here's your idea go and write about it coming up with a new idea is about combinational creativity it's about taking two existing ideas building on the shoulders of giants and connecting them in a way that nobody has done before I'd love to see a concrete example of this can you show us your process for an article that you published recently okay this one about weak arguments so let's have a look at what it looks like in Rome but this is something that I've been reading about I've noticed after a while a few times where it came up in different places where I was reading articles so if you look at the bottom here in the references I will have those two notes that I have one of them is from Pilgrim from a blog post where he lists a lot of different ways that people build weak arguments that look like they're strong but they're absolutely not and here's another one from the philosopher Daniel Danette where he's sharing when someone has written a weak argument and is when they use an operator such as Shirley because when you say surely you're actually not sure and you're hoping that the reader is sure it's like obviously well if it's obvious why are you saying it exactly so here I have those two ways that those two thinkers have devised to spot weak arguments and I'm going to start working on an outline based on this and I do it straight into that Hub page here and I have an introduction I have a few sections I pull here if you look at this I didn't retype this this is actually automatically pulled from the reference what do you mean when you say it was pulled into this this page I can drag it and and I go like this and here it is whenever I'm ready with the outline this is when I move on to the next step I paste it into a Google doc and then I work from there so this is the Google Doc obviously you're seeing the final version after I've done all of the writing but if you compare what it looks like here it's a pretty similar but also there were things that I didn't really write in the outline so here I'm gonna give one two examples question mark didn't seem very sure I would do it or not so I did end up adding the examples but I made them up and wrote them on the Spot while I was writing the article because that was something that was really hard to know at the outline stage whether it would actually help and enhance the content or whether it would just feel like unnecessary fluff this is honestly more art yes than science yes you just fill it when you're writing whether it's helping or not whether it flows in a way that makes sense another thing that I really like about about Google Docs is that it plays really well with WordPress which is the content management system that I use so once I'm done I just have to copy paste the draft into WordPress and I just love how in this case it's frictionless no friction in the publication process so I can publish often and get good feedback from people the Internet is just a massive co-creation project so instead of trying to have your own perfect little article immutable that's going to be your legacy I think it's way healthier and way more productive to see it as this giant playground where everyone is contributing and you're bringing your unfinished idea and saying hey look this is my thing what about your thing oh what about if we bring our things together what is going to come out of that but it will still be a source of learning collaboration connection with other people to figure out your own note-taking style watch this video on choosing the right second brain app for you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
