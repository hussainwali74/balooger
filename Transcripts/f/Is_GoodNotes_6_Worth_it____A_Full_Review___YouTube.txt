Is_GoodNotes_6_Worth_it____A_Full_Review___YouTube
 
[Music] I've been a good notes user for a really long time now and it's actually been my kind of go-to Note Taker on the iPad for a fair few years and now goodnotes has evolved it's no longer good notes 5 but we're now on good note 6 and there's a lot of focus on that threaded word Ai and there's a bunch of other little usability updates in here which are definitely worth talking about oh and I am in the process of making a general best note-taking app for iPad so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss that one but anyway let's get right into it first up let's talk about the new features which I really like and I think are really decent additions to the overall experience firstly is circle to lassu which is such a great feature basically this lets you Circle some text that you've got and then when you long press it with the apple pencil you can move it around you can also do this with your finger but if you're anyone like me and you often run out of space or anything like that and you want to move text around you have to jump back and forth on the lasso tool to do it not anymore you can just circle it and move it I absolutely love that I think it's fantastic and the second one is scribble to delete this one's kind of obvious but basically if you write something wrong you can literally just scribble it out now rather than having go into the rubber tool and then back or double tapping the pencil you can just do that with a quick scribble which is great and if your handwriting is not drawing up like mine isn't you can actually scribble out little bits of words as well and just go back to what you were doing it's really great another new feature I really like is the spelling correction with AI so while you're handwriting good notes will spell check as you go and then underline anything which it doesn't recognize and then if you long press on it it will actually give you some spelling correction and then it will use a little bit of AI to try and fill in where you went wrong this isn't perfect right now it's a little bit wonky and if your handwriting isn't massively neat like mine it can often look like you've spelled something wrong when you haven't really you're just being a bit sloppy but also if it corrects a word within a sentence sometimes the corrected spelling will go over the other words you've got in that sentence which just makes it look a bit messy oh and it's also worth mentioning as well even though this was added with goodnotes five it's quite a late feature to get added you now have full audio recording and good note 6. so if you're listening to a lecture or anything like that and you want to record while you're taking notes that's a simple tap of the button and I'm really happy that that's here the ui's had a bit of a tweak as well so now it's a little bit easier if you want to type up notes with the keyboard or if you want to move to the pen and you've got contextual menus on that which I think aren't the neatest but at least they're really obvious where the difference is and jumping to the main interface you can actually now finally color your folders and even give them an icon as well I don't know why it took them so long to get around to this but I'm really happy it's here here it just means going through your notes and putting them in files and folders and then marking them accordingly is just easier there's also a Marketplace within the app now that's really obvious to go to and while it's quite small there's not loads in here I think it's good that this app has it it's nice to kind of scroll through things and if you need a new notebook or if you want to look at anything else on there you can and it's got its own dedicated space whereas before it always felt like an afterthought so it's nice to have that fully integrated now you can now also completely customize your notebook templates too which is great this feels a little overdue as well but you can now pick your paper type paper size and notebook cover and then have that as your own templates you can just make loads of them if you need to but the final update and the one that I'm actually kind of most excited about in a way is the fact that good notes is now finally cross-platform which is fantastic I used to mark good notes down a little bit because you could never access it on the web or on Windows but now you can it's on iPad iPhone Android Windows Mac everything and on the web as well although I don't think the web client is out yet and unless I just can't seem to find it but yeah this is great it means wherever you write your notes and especially if you're a student if you write them at home and then you're using a college computer back at school or something like that you still have access to those notes which is great all right let's talk about bad points because actually there's quite a few to go along with the good ones too and first up this isn't a brand new separate app this is good notes five just updated to good note 6 which means if you're on good notes 5 you're going to be constantly kind of pushed to upgrade to six and sometimes if your app store is upgrading automatically it will just push you over to good note 6. now you can roll this back in settings on good note 6 but it couldn't be more obvious they want you to leave that behind and that's totally understandable but good note 6 has now moved to a subscription-based service now the pricing on this overall is another bad point it's just really kind of confusing and not all features are with everything there's a free tier which is kind of fair enough good notes there's always a paid thing so to have a free tier is awesome you get a few books and you can kind of just test it out which is fine there's a yearly subscription which is 9.99 which kind of gives you access to absolutely everything that's clearly the one they want people on and then there's also a one-time purchase which is 29.99 which is just a one-off purchase which gives you everything but it doesn't give you access to the multiple clients so you can only access it on your iPad which is just really strange I kind of understand they can't just give away those apps free but having a one-off pricing for those two would maybe help with that but that brings me to the next point is this overall kind of messaging about the pricing and what happens with goodnotes 5 has just been kind of weird as well it only takes a quick look on their Twitter feed when they announce six to see all the issues that's come up and no one really knows what's going on with all their notes and notes five and their websites had a few updates to try and explain better what's going on so I really feel like that could have just been handled better and if you've paid for good notes on your Mac before like I had that app has now just gone so if you're on good notes 5 then using that app on the computer you can't anymore which is just kind of bad the whole thing should have been exciting but it's kind of been more of a weird kind of upgrade path with no massive information which I think has been a real shame also going back to the goodnotes app as a whole there's also no internal links to different pages within your notes either which is kind of a request that I feel like we've been asking for for the longest time and this would be a perfect way to roll it out but that's still not here yet either before moving on I did want to thank the sponsor of this video paper like and hey look if you know me you know that paperlike is the only screen protector for iPad that I really recommend if you do need one I've used them for a long time between all of my iPads and I really do think they're the way to go paperlight does double duty for your iPad too not only protecting the screen but also it really makes it feel like you're writing drawing or sketching on paper they do this with nanodoc technology which adds resistance and grip to your pencil inputs taking away that unnatural feeling of writing on glass and replacing it with that familiar papery feel it's a really sweet way to upgrade your iPad experience this is the paperlike 2.1 as well which is an updated version to boot meaning you're getting an expert backed Swiss based manufactured product which gives you much better overall visibility and Clarity when using your iPad compared to their earlier versions so if you want to check paperlight out then head to the link in the description below and of course a huge thank you goes out to paperlike for sponsoring this video so that's what I like and what I don't like but there are some things which are actually kind of really tough for me to comment on because they're just not directed at me and they're just features that I won't really use and the first up with that is the maths AI help this is a feature which takes things like equations and sums and all of those sorts of things and then the AI will turn them into kind of text in real time and also give you the answers if you need them you can also download previous maths papers or SATs and things like that and then answer those questions in real time in a proper kind of test scenario which is awesome I kind of wish that was there when I was at school but yeah that's tough for me to comment on I haven't the maths in the longest time so I don't even know if it's correcting it right because I just don't know much about maths anymore I do really like the fact that you can download previous exams though I think that'd be awesome if they could do that across all the countries and then also bring them to different subjects as well I can imagine science tests and English tests being on there that would be really awesome so that's something I would love to see another thing which is like Ugh for like me to comment on because I can't really it is the fact that they're promising loads of new features as well and that's awesome it's always great to see when a company is promising to bring new updates to an app but you should kind of never buy an app based on what they're promising to deliver you should get it on what's out right now but they do have some cool stuff planned it looks like it's an AI chat bot coming and there's loads of other community feedback features which you can see on the website which they're addressing too but again hard for me to comment on because I don't know if those features are actually coming or not so my final thoughts and do I overall think it's worth upgrading to or using and and that probably is answer enough for a lot of you out there I do think this is a good upgrade in general though it's better than good notes five in pretty much every single way some of the new AI stuff although we're a little bit gimmicky right now shows some cool promise of the future and I think the new gestures and UI just speed up the whole process which is always good you can never complain about that however I'm not sure it warrants the upgrade to good note 6 like a full numbered release this definitely feels like a 5.5 or something like that and more than anything it kind of feels like a way of goodness getting people onto this new subscription pricing rather than releasing like a fully fledged all singing all dancing all exciting new app and I don't hold good notes kind of wholly responsible for moving to a subscription pricing that's kind of happening across the board now but my only other feedback on that is when does it all end what's to stop a calculator popping up monthly or any other app for that matter so I think if you're on good notes 5 and you're totally happy with it you'll probably get updated to good note 6 anyway but you can just roll it back and continue using it but if you are new to goodnotes then you're not going to have a choice this is the only version of it you can use and I think that's pretty much what I can say I'm going to take the upgrade I think good note 6 is good enough and I think 10 pounds a year isn't too bad but if you're using good notes 5 and you're more than happy with it then just keep using that because really it's absolutely fine so that rounds up all my thoughts about good note 6. I hope you enjoyed the video I'd love to know what you think what do you think about this new pricing structure and what do you think about the app in general leave a comment below because I'd love to read through those and like I mentioned I am working on a big video about the best note taking app for iPad so that'll be on here soon and as always I will see you all in the next one thank you
