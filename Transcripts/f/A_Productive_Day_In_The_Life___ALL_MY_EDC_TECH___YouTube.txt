A_Productive_Day_In_The_Life___ALL_MY_EDC_TECH___YouTube
 
[Music] now that it's summer I've been starting as many days as I can by going skating it's a short drive for me and my friends and we usually get there around 8 in the morning and stay until about 10. we lovingly call this the over 30 session because we can usually get the park to ourselves as it's way too early for everyone else my use of tech pretty much starts right here though I'll track all of my skating with the Apple watch I've been using the series 8 for about seven to eight months now I guess and while it has been great I do wish I'd opted for the ultra or just a series seven because they're so similar but it's been a nice update over my Series 4. this is also where I'll use my iPhone 14 pro Max loads too I love taking photos on this thing and if you follow me on Instagram Twitter then you might have already seen some of these skating photos but honestly I've been so impressed by what it throws out I always shoot in Pro raw mode which allows me to edit the photos in Lightroom which is something I always do and the results are always really nice I used to take a smaller camera like my Fuji 2 places like this but it's nice now that I can just rely on my phone I also end up filming a fair amount on my phone too because it's fun to watch tricks back usually to see where we're going wrong or sometimes just to share them in the group chat we usually skate until around 10 o'clock or until we're all knackered and then head home after getting home and showering I've got a meeting for my brand kuroku and this is exciting because it's in our new studio location and I really cannot wait to show this off to you all but it's not quite ready yet so you might have to wait just a little bit longer if you weren't already overly sure kuroku is the brand I run with my friend Rachel we sell wallpaper packs photography presets stickers and some other small physical items that you might have already seen or even purchased oh we also have a Lo-Fi YouTube channel as well so I'll link that below if you want to check it out for working with kuroku though we both really love to work with our iPads most of our ideas for products start on there as sketches or as ideas written down or just Pinterest boards that we share with each other today we're discussing how the sales of our last product the Poke mug went and about the next wallpaper set we're currently designing we also want to revamp our art print offerings so we're looking at those today too now that we have a more dedicated space and we can work together a bit more properly it's so much easier to get things done than it was before which is just awesome we've actually decided to launch a newsletter which will be linked to this Channel and kuroku as well so if you want to hear some more of my thoughts on Tech that I don't cover on the channel here or just advice in general and you want to stay update with everything kuroku and maybe get a cheeky discount too then I'll link that below after our meeting I leave Rachel to do some design work and I decide to head home for the rest of the day to work from I haven't moved everything over to the studio yet so all of my stuff is still there for the walk back I'll use my recently revived airpods Pro and once again use the Apple watch to track my activity I'll also usually treat myself to a coffee as there's a shop on the way and today is no different I can't seem to resist walking past the store I actually remembered to bring my reusable cut today which is useful because I always forget there's a couple things I want to talk to you about I've managed to fix my airpods weirdly because these were dying but I actually charged them up with the wire rather than wirelessly and they seem to have jumped back to life which is awesome so I'm really happy about that and as well I wanted to say that I'm getting more and more used to this bag from the design this is everyday bag if you watch my EDC video you'll know I wasn't huge on this I managed to rejig the inside so it just works a lot better than it was before which is awesome but anyway there you go I'll get home from grabbing a coffee around 12 30 and after getting some lunch the first thing on my list for the day is to make a reel for Instagram for pretty much all of my short form content I'm using my Sony a74 with the Tamron 28 270 lens this gives me great coverage for pretty much everything I need and the quality from the Sony is just wonderful I shoot everything in 4k so I can crop in afterwards and create more frames out of other frames if I need to I'm still using this ridiculous setup of having a tripod in an Ikea trolley to film everything when it comes to shooting vertically but it really works and it helps speed up my workflow okay so I just got done filming a reel for this keyboard and if you follow me on Instagram you've probably already seen it because I posted it just now and this video is coming out after that but this is the new 5 field 75 it's a mechanical keyboard and it's got loads of interesting dials and switches over it it's got this one on the top here and it's got loads of little clicks and Clacks you can kind of customize to all sorts of things that you want to and it's obviously not something I would normally go for it's a little bit more gamer than I'm kind of used to but I'd love to know what you think it's quite an interesting one and I do really like this handle on the top it's quite a weird little thing but carrying it around it actually as a design thing I actually quite like it but yeah let me know what you think about in the comments below it might be a little too mad for me but I do like new five stuff so yeah let me know in the comments below after posting the Reel and packing everything away I sit down for the next few hours to edit my current YouTube video well for as long as Pocky lets me when I'm working at the desk he'll often jump right up and sit right in the way but I can't move in so I just work around him even if it really slows me down my current desk setup is still the same as it has been for a little while now and I've got a full video on the entire office and setup which I'll link below if you want to see it but I'm still using the M1 Max Max studio for all of my video and photo editing and honestly it's just been fantastic I switched from my custom PC to this and it's one of the best moves I've ever made for my content workflows this thing screams through tricky video footage and it is sped up my editing endlessly I really couldn't be happier with the decision I'll keep working in my office until around 5 and then step away from the computer for the day the next thing I do which involves Tech isn't something I've ever really spoken about on the channel or online before but I've been working out every weekday for over a year now I've been using the body coach app on my iPhone to try and take better care of myself because about a year ago I was honestly feeling really self-conscious about my weight and how I was looking on camera since building the workouts into my routine now and changing a little bit about what I eat I've managed to lose a fair amount of the weight and I'm feeling much better about being on camera now which is good I track all of my workouts on the Apple watch and this style of workout which is hit training is really where the Apple watch kind of all makes sense you can see your heart rate calories burned and closing all three of those Rings is a really nice way to motivate yourself and it's the main reason I still wear the Apple watch over my other watches most days also doing this workout combined with skating in the morning is a great way to burn calories after catching up with Joe Wicks it's time for dinner and this introduces the next piece of tech I use every day and I do use it a lot and this is the Apple home pod I have this in the kitchen and it's basically an essential for whenever I'm making dinner I'll usually put on some music I'm loving which right now is still the latest one the year's album or sometimes a podcast if the dinner takes a lot longer to make and because we use hellofresh or Gusto here in the UK dinner can take a really long time to make but it's pretty much always worth it and look while I think that homepod has its issues especially with Spotify compatibility and the fact that you have to have it plugged in all the time it's an incredible sounding speaker I was using a Robert single speaker before and this absolutely blows it away and being able to tap your iPhone to it to transfer music is pretty awesome after clearing up from dinner I try my best to not work into the evenings and although that's difficult sometimes especially when you work for yourself I've got plenty of distractions in the lounge I've got a few consoles in here including the super famicom I picked up in Japan in 2019 but right now I'm spending all my time with the Nintendo switch and tears of the Kingdom which is just a stunning game breath of the wild was in my top three games of all time and I never really thought we'd get a sequel so to play one that's nearly better in every way it's just a wild feeling and I'm treasuring every moment I can get with it if I can I always opt to play on TV because I think Zelda really works on that bigger screen but now that I've got the Nintendo switch OLED it's actually really wonderful to play handheld and if my partner wants to watch something on TV then I can just dock out and play it handheld and still get a really nice experience that screen absolutely pops on here and I'm really glad I went with this upgrade over my original switch when nighttime finally rolls in and it's time for bed there's one final piece of tech that I use every night and that's the anchor three in one cube with magsafe I really really love this charger because it can take my iPhone Apple watch and airpods and charge them all at once and I just find the design on this really wonderful this was sitting at my desk for quite a long time but it's migrated to the bedroom now and it serves as my overnight charger for all of my Essential Tech so that just about rounds up every single piece of tech I'm using in my day-to-day life at the moment I hope you enjoyed this video is a bit of a change of pace from the normal one and if you did get this far into it drop a skateboard Emoji in the comments below so I can see who got this far and of course I will make a video on the studio space when it's ready it's not quite there yet but it soon will be but until then I will see you all in the next one foreign [Music]
