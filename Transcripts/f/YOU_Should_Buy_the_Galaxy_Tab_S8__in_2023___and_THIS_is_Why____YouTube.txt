- Every time Samsung releases a new tablet, in this case, the Tab S9+, people automatically rush to buy the newest option. But sometimes you need to ask yourself if the features in the new tablet justify the added cost. So today we're gonna talk about why if you're looking for a tablet, you should still consider buying the Tab S8+. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. For full transparency I bought the Tab S8+ with my own money. It wasn't given or gifted to me. I also purchased a Tab S9+ because I want to be able to shoot a detailed comparison. And the first reason to still consider buying the Tab S8+ is the price. Right now you can buy it new for $799 which is 200 bucks less than the Tab S9+. So you're immediately looking at 20% off. If you're willing to buy an open box model you can get it for as low as $562, which is almost half off. But what about the new features? As far as size, there's no upgrade with the newer model so you're still getting a 12.4 inch display and the dimensions are virtually identical. The design has also stayed pretty much the same. Flat edges, curved corners, four AKG tuned speakers and a USB-C for charging and connecting accessories. Both devices support Wi-Fi 6E and the newer Tab S9+ offers Bluetooth 5.3 versus 5.2 but that's not really anything that would make me upgrade or spend more money. One area that may be important to you is that the Tab S9+ has an IP68 rating so you're getting dust resistance and then water resistance in up to one and a half meters for 30 minutes. Now I don't typically use my tablets in environments where that's a real risk but if you do, this feature is definitely something that you should consider. And for biometric authentication, the Tab S8+ has the same options as the newer model. So an on display fingerprint sensor or facial recognition with the front facing camera. As far as the displays, the Tab S8+ has one of the best displays that I've seen on a tablet. It's a 12.4 inch, 120 Hertz super AMOLED display with support for HDR10+. We're getting the same resolution as the new model, the same aspect ratio, and the same pixel density and the only difference that we notice is that the Tab S9+ has a dynamic AMOLED 2X display. So I'm curious to see if the difference is noticeable and meaningful. A dynamic AMOLED 2X is considered to be better technology because it offers better contrast, better color accuracy and reduced blue light emission. Now before we get to processing power and battery life where we will see some important updates, what if you're looking for a Samsung Galaxy Book to pair up with your tablet and you wanna save some money? That brings me to today's sponsor Best Buy and their back to school deals. Right now you can save up to 300 bucks on select Samsung Galaxy Book laptops.

And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now moving on to processing power. I've been happy with the performance of my Tab S8+ which I've had since the day was released which is about a year and a half ago. Now of course one of the important upgrades with the Tab S9+ is the newer, more powerful and more efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip. As far as performance, we're seeing improvements for both single and multi-core performance. We're also seeing enhanced GPU performance with the latest chip and this additional capacity will provide a better user experience when performing resource intensive tasks like video editing or when playing more demanding games. Now this is an area where not every user is the same so if you regularly push your tablet to the limit, then additional performance is valuable. But if you're simply using your tablet to browse the web to go on social media and consume content then you are unlikely to notice any difference between the two. Keep in mind that having additional headroom in terms of performance is nice, especially as the tablet ages but it really comes down to how often you replace your gear. I use my Tab S8+ for all the games that I usually play, so games like PUBG and Genshin and it has worked really well for me so far. Now battery life is another story altogether. I've been happy with the Tab S8+ battery and there's been no upgrade in terms of capacity with the Tab S9+, it's still 10,090 milliamp per hour, but there's no question that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip makes a noticeable difference in terms of battery life. We're also getting a new vapor cooling chamber for better heat dissipation. So I'm super excited for my detailed battery test and fully expect a newer lineup to come out ahead. Now both tablets run Android 13 and One UI 5 so you're getting the same set of features, both are great for multitasking with pop-up windows and three tiled apps running at the same time. Now of course, the Tab S8+ originally came with Android 12 and One UI 4 so you are going to get longer support if you buy the newer tablet. But again, you need to decide if that extra year of support is worth the extra money. Now I love using DeX on my Tab S8+ because it offers a very similar user experience to what I get on a laptop or a desktop. I get desktop icons, a task bar, and floating windows. I can even attach an external display keyboard and mouse and run a super capable dual display setup. Another thing that I can do is use my Tab as a plus as a second display for my Windows desktop or laptop with Samsung's second screen. And this is a great feature when I travel or even if I'm getting some work done at a coffee shop. Now, when we look at dedicated accessories, the Tab S8+ has two keyboard options from Samsung. So it really depends on which layout you prefer. Do you want the more sturdy book covered keyboard slim without a track pad, or do you like the original book covered keyboard where you have a track pad? You can separate the keyboard and still protect the back and you can secure the S Pen while it's charging. And speaking of the S Pen, the Tab S8+ comes with a Bluetooth enabled S Pen, which works great. The newer Tab S9+ comes with a newer version of the S Pen which has IP68 rating for water and dust resistance just like the new tablet can also be charged regardless of which direction you place it on the back which is nice to have but not really a deciding factor for me. As far as cameras, the rear facing ultra wide camera was upgraded from six megapixels to eight megapixels. The main one is still 13 megapixels and the selfie camera remains 12 megapixels. For me, cameras on tablets are not super important because I'm always gonna have better options on my phone. And my phone is also much more convenient to use. I mostly use the cameras on my tablets for scanning documents and for video calls. So again, this wouldn't really be a reason for me to upgrade. As far as configurations, the Tab S8+ is available with 128, 256 and 512 gigabytes of storage. You can relatively inexpensively add up to one terabyte of internal storage using the micro SD card slot. This should give you plenty of storage for the files, apps, and games that you need. There's no question that the newer Tab S9+ offers some advantages over the older model but depending on the price difference, I still think that the Tab S8+ is an outstanding tablet and a fantastic value even today.
