HALF_MEASURE__14__M3_MacBook_Pro_vs_15__M2_MacBook_Air___YouTube
 
- Apple made this really tough. Now that the entry-level 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro sells for $1,600, (cash register chimes) is it a better buy for the average user than the larger, but thinner and lighter 15-inch M2 MacBook Air? I'm not really sure, so let's talk about it. Now in terms of the overall shape, both laptops have the same boxy design where the 15-inch Air looks like you took the 14-inch MacBook Pro and then stretched it out to make it bigger, but thinner. The MacBook Air has a larger footprint, while the MacBook Pro weighs about 0.1 pounds, or 40 grams more, and it's noticeably thicker. So the MacBook Air is pretty much the same height as the base of the MacBook Pro. From a portability standpoint, you typically think of the Air as the more portable device, but there's a psychological trick going on here. So I factually know that the weight difference is negligible and the Air has a bigger footprint. But whenever I use it or when I transport it, it just feels like I'm using an ultralight laptop, whereas the MacBook Pro feels more substantial. Now looking at the ports, Apple took a half measure in improving the entry-level M3 MacBook Pro. So here are the specs and what's really important. The MacBook Air has two Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 ports and a MagSafe port on the left side, and then a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the right. The MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe port, and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the left, and then an SDXC card reader and an HDMI port on the right. So first of all, with both laptops, you can only charge or connect USB-C accessories from the left side. If you actually want a USB-C port on the right side, then you'll need to upgrade the MacBook Pro to the M3 Pro chip and it's so confusing. MacBook M3, M3 MacBook Pro, M3 Pro, MacBook Pro. I don't know how they could have done it better, but it's a little confusing. I love the SDXC card reader on the MacBook Pro, this way I don't have to bring a hub or a dedicated card reader with me every time I travel. But I know that that's not a meaningful advantage for every user. Now, both laptops only support a single external display. You can go up to 6K 60 hertz using the Thunderbolt Port on either MacBook, but the MacBook Pro also gives you the option of going to 4K 120 using the HDMI port. And if you want dual external displays, again, you'll need to upgrade to the M3 Pro Chip or check out my MacBook accessories video instead. And speaking of displays, here you have an interesting choice to make. We're getting a 15.3-inch display on the MacBook Air versus 14.2 on the MacBook Pro. So of course, the MacBook Air is larger, but surprisingly, the MacBook Pro has thinner bezels. Now, in terms of the actual display itself, it's an easy win for the Liquid Retina XDR display on the MacBook Pro. Don't get me wrong, the 15 inch display on the MacBook Air is very nice, but the MacBook Pro display is just next level. It's super sharp, the colors look amazingly crisp. And because it's a mini LED display versus LCD on the MacBook Air, we're getting a lot more dimming zones with darker blacks. Now, even though the MacBook Pro is smaller, it has a higher resolution. But what's interesting here is that because of how scaling is handled, you actually see more of a webpage on the MacBook Air than on the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro is a hundred nits brighter for SDR content, and then goes all the way up to a thousand nits of sustained full-screen brightness and 1,600 nits peak brightness for HDR content. So if all you watch is SDR content, then it's not a major difference. It's still there, but it's just not a massive difference. Realistically though, more and more content is being created in HDR, and then the difference is definitely noticeable. So both displays are P3 displays with support for 1 billion colors, which is great. But the MacBook Air has a 60 hertz display, whereas the MacBook Pro has ProMotion, and this is Apple's adaptive refresh rate of up to 120 hertz. Essentially, depending on what you're doing, the display can go from 24 hertz all the way up to 120 hertz in order to optimize the user experience and maximize battery life. So if you're looking for the best quality display, that's definitely the MacBook Pro. Now, if you have a MacBook and a gaming PC or a MacBook and a Mac and you want them to easily share a single workstation, check out this KVM Switch from today's sponsor, Anker. What the Anker KVM Switch does is allow you to quickly connect two devices to a single monitor setup or a dual 4K display setup while sharing the same keyboard, mouse and speakers. And this way you don't have to put away your gaming mouse and your mechanical keyboard every time you want to use your laptop. All I do is plug one USB-C cable into my MacBook, and with a click of a button I can switch between my MacBook and my desktop. There's a ton of ports for various accessories, so I can share things like external SSDs and flash drives between devices. The MacBook is being charged with up to a hundred watts with the same USB-C cable, and I never have to worry about battery life. So if you're looking for a convenient docking station for dual devices, that could be Windows, macOS, or a combination, search for the Anker KVM Switch. And thank you to Anker for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now moving on to the keyboard and trackpad, we're getting the same keyboard on both devices. It's one of the best keyboards that I've used on any laptop, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. It's comfortable to type on, the keys have a good amount of bounce back. We're getting a full height row of function keys, and there's a touch ID button for biometric authentication. As far as the track pad, Apple might make the best track pad in the market. It's super responsive, it's accurate, you can click anywhere on it. And the only noticeable difference is that the 15-inch MacBook Air has a larger version. The one other advantage I'm gonna give the MacBook Air is that it's a little bit more comfortable to type on because of the larger palm rest assembly and the thinner base. As far as the camera, both MacBooks use Apple's new 1080p camera, which works very well for video calls. And here's a quick sample. Here's a camera and microphone test of the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro and the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get and the type of audio that you should expect to get for video calls. In both cases, we have a notch, and I'm gonna go ahead and add my usual disclaimer. Yes, I wish it wasn't there if I didn't have to give up on the thin bezels, which can't be done right now with the current camera module. No, it doesn't bother me. And no, it doesn't interfere with how I actually use any of the MacBooks that have a notch. And still, the one feature that I wish we got with it is Face ID. Now, when we look at the speaker systems, both MacBooks have a six-speaker sound system with force canceling woofers. With the MacBook Air, the speakers are hidden in Hinge. And with the MacBook Pro, we've got the traditional speaker grills on each side of the keyboard. Now, Apple calls the sound system on the MacBook Pro high-fidelity, and in this case, it's not just marketing hype. The speakers on the MacBook Air are actually quite good, especially considering that you have to look really hard to find them in the hinge, but they can't compete with the MacBook Pro sound system. The audio on the MacBook Pro is fuller, it's warmer, and it has more presence to it. So if you like to use the speakers on your laptop, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is definitely the way to go. Now let's quickly talk about processing power. And I say quickly because if you're looking for the more powerful device, that's obviously going to be the MacBook Pro with the newer M3 chip. But the MacBook Air actually has plenty of processing power for the vast majority of users. Both the M2 and the M3 come with an 8-core CPU with four high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. We immediately see that the M3 comes out ahead for single-core performance. Then, of course, this continues when we test multi-core performance 'cause they have the same number of cores. Now looking at both 10-core GPUs, again, you'd expect the MacBook Pro to come out ahead, and it does. And we're also getting hardware-accelerated ray-tracing with the M3 chip. Another advantage we see with the MacBook Pro has to do with sustained performance. So because it has an active cooling system or a fan, when you push the system and it starts to heat up, the MacBook Pro can just turn on the fan and then cool the system down and maintain the same level of performance. And we can see that pushing the system to a hundred percent for 30 minutes, we're getting the same performance as the much shorter baseline test. With the MacBook Air, which has no fan, the system has to throttle performance in order to cool down, and we're seeing about a 7.5% drop in performance. So here's how I would look at it. The typical person isn't pushing their MacBook Pro to the limit for that long on a regular basis. And even if they do every once in a while, assuming that the baseline performance of the M2 MacBook Air is enough for them, it's only a slight drop on very rare occasions. Now, if you regularly batch hundreds of high-res photos in Lightroom, if you're working with super demanding video files and you're rendering large video projects that require things like stabilization and motion graphics, or if you're using 3D applications, then you would definitely notice improved performance on the MacBook Pro. And that type of user is already likely to know that they're better off with the MacBook Pro. Both MacBooks come with eight gigabytes of unified memory and can be upgraded to 16 or 24 gigs. But let's talk about SSD speeds and battery life where we see two important differences. The 256 gigabyte version of the MacBook Air comes with significantly slower SSD speeds than the larger sizes. And in either case, the MacBook Pro comes with an even faster SSD. But how does this actually impact data transfer? We copied 20 gigabytes from a super fast external SSD and found that the 256 gigabyte MacBook Air finished in 15.02 seconds, the 512 gigabyte in 8.89 seconds, and the MacBook Pro in 8.19 seconds. As far as battery, the MacBook Pro has a slightly larger battery at 70 watt/hour versus 66.5 on the MacBook Air. But while both are rated for 15 hours of wireless web browsing, the MacBook Air is rated for 18 hours of Apple TV app movie playback versus 22 hours on the MacBook Pro. Now, my guess is that this has something to do with the new media engine on the M3 chip that now includes support for AV1 decode, which in turn provides a more efficient and higher quality video experience from streaming services. In my actual daily use with both, I really only charge them every other day, or I might even wait even longer than that. But the actual battery life depends on what I'm doing. So obviously if I'm watching movies, the MacBook Pro lasts me longer. But even if I'm working in Lightroom, Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro, especially if I'm exporting images or rendering video, then the MacBook Pro still lasts me longer because it's able to complete those tasks faster and more efficiently. And both MacBooks come with chargers. The MacBook Air comes with either a 35-watt dual USB-C port or a 70 watt single port power adapter. And the MacBook Pro comes with a 67-watt adapter, which can be upgraded to a 96-watt adapter for 20 bucks. Now let's talk about pricing, because initially we saw a $300 difference, (cash register chimes) but that doesn't really tell the whole story. I'm going to use the standard Apple pricing, but you can usually find better deals using the links in the description. So the M3 MacBook Pro comes with 512 gigabytes of internal storage, versus 256 gigabytes on the M2 MacBook Air, and that alone would be a $200 upgrade. Now, personally, I think that a lot of users should consider going to 512 on any MacBook, unless it's essentially being used for browsing the web and with web-based applications. These chips are extremely capable and will continue to perform for years. So I don't want you to have a perfectly good laptop in terms of processing power, but then run out of storage. I'm okay-ish with the Air starting out with eight gigabytes of unified memory for basic users. But I really feel like the Pro should start with 16 gigabytes, again, especially because of how long this chip should last. In any case, going up to 16 gigabytes is an additional $200 worth either MacBook, and that brings the M3 MacBook Pro within $200 of the M3 Pro MacBook Pro model. And that's why I said at the beginning that I'm not so sure about it. But that's a topic for another video. So as far as the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air versus the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro, the choice comes down to the larger display and thinner design of the MacBook Air, versus the smaller but brighter and noticeably better display, twice the internal storage, better speakers, improved battery life for streaming video, more ports, and an upgrade from Wi-Fi 6 to Wi-Fi 6E.
