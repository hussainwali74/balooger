iPhone_14_Pro_Max___A_Day_in_the_Life___YouTube
 
foreign from the ones I've done before I'm not going to be sitting at my desk for ages or wandering around my local town in fact today I'm heading all the way to London to see some sites meet another YouTuber I've been following for a long time and to give the iPhone 14 pro Max a proper workout we're going to be using it pretty much all day so it's going to be a really good show of what it can do once again I'm bringing the field arrive in Cancun 17 bag with me today as I do have a very small camera kit on me but otherwise I'm not bringing anything else no iPad no MacBook no nothing the iPhone is going to be the only Computing device with me for the entire day so I'll be keeping an eye on the battery life too getting to London from where I live is about a three and a half hour Journey some of that is by car but it's mostly by train and that's where my iPhone use really does start I'll use the train time to check a bunch of emails listen to Spotify for pretty much the whole way and also catch up on some YouTube videos I've got saved for later I've been really loving this anchor mag go excess three recently and I've turned it off so it's not charging my phone but this holds up the iPhone so when I'm watching YouTube or something like that it just gives you a much better angle and it's really perfect for travel too the train gets into Paddington Station at about 10 30 in the morning and because it's such a beautiful station we actually decide to stop there and take a bunch of photos and video I am using the iPhone's Pro raw setting which has given me those full 48 megapixel shots and these photos look absolutely gorgeous if you're not looking for depth on an iPhone and you focus on kind of shape and color you can get some really really nice results and Paddington Station has so much going on it was great to take some photos there I am editing all of these photos that you see in this video and they're doing my Lightroom preset pack so if you'd like to edit like I do then I'll link those below after getting all the photos and video that I wanted to and paying a visit to the bear from darkest Peru we need to head over to the tube stop to see where we're going our first stop is Covent Garden so I'll check my phone and use Google Maps to make sure I know where I'm going saying luckily to get to Covent Garden from Pennington is really easy so we head on down and go there I'm using Apple pay on the Underground for everything which is super convenient and much to our surprise when we got to the tube stop it was completely empty and it was just a kind of strange feeling so we actually spent a little bit of time in there getting some more photos and video with the iPhone and Sam took some photos on his camera as well it was kind of a strange experience being completely alone in a tube stop but we made the most of it and then we moved on to Covent Garden after getting to Covent Garden we stopped in the grind coffee shop for a quick coffee and something to eat before we crack on I also use this time to check Instagram and to actually draft out a few posts which I had going live that day and to check Google Maps for our first real stop of the day which is Goodwin's Court Goodwin's court is this tiny little Street just off Covent Garden and it was really interesting to see it because it has this complete kind of Diagon Alley Vibe it looks really Victorian and if you're a fan of kind of Harry Potter and those sorts of things it's definitely worth seeing it was really old and we spent a bunch of time there getting more photos more video on the iPhone and just kind of enjoying walking down it because it did have such a vibe to it after enjoying Goodman's Court we head back to Covent Garden and into the main kind of market area where I spent a bit of time taking a bunch more photos on the iPhone and a bunch more video as well and this is kind of where I started to notice that how nice the 48 megapixel photos are on this phone I took a bunch more and we spent a little bit of time just standing around editing them on Lightroom and we just got some really really nice results generally speaking when I head out to take photos or video specifically I always take my Sony or Fuji with me because I just love shooting with a real camera but spending some time with the iPhone today and especially here this just made me realize that for you know General snaps and general photography you can get some really fantastic results before leaving as well we also paid a visit to the Apple Store I don't have one where I live so whenever I get a chance to go to one I do and the Covent Garden one really was beautiful they had a talk going on about how to use the iPhone camera a little bit better which kind of funny to see and we just explored the shop Sam was also debating picking up a new Apple watch strap but then he saw the price and for better of it and with that we decided to leave after this I checked my iPhone battery and I'm on about 65 which honestly is a little bit lower than I was expecting it to be but I have been using it since six o'clock in the morning so maybe it's not too bad oh and if you are enjoying the wallpapers you're seeing in this video this is from my new pack this is called the bokeh pack and it's inspired by the bokeh you see in photography and honestly I'm so so pleased with how it came out we spent a lot of time making sure these were just right and I think it's probably my favorite all paper pack we've ever done these look absolutely beautiful on iPhone and on desktop and laptop and iPad so if you want to help support the channel then I'll link them below go check them out after enjoying Covent Garden it was time to meet another YouTuber and general online Creator Olia who's someone I've been following for a really long time and I was really excited to meet up and chat with him but this is where things got a little bit more tricky for us we use Google Maps once again to go down to the tube station to make sure we're getting on the right tube and all of that and turns out we got there and the tube was delayed and it was delayed again and it was delayed again and then that tube got outright canceled so then we had to go back out to the surface uh to phone Olia and make a big apology that we're going to be late and then we had to find two other tube stations and two other tube stops to finally get on the tlr which took us to Canary Wharf after finally getting to Canary Wharf we finally sit down for some awesome burgers with Olia and it was really great to chat with him I've been friends with Olia online for quite a long time but meeting up in person is just kind of that different experience and it was great to chat YouTube and Tech in general our favorite cameras and how we stay motivated and just tips and tricks and how how we kind of approach work when it comes to YouTube and it's really nice to talk to someone who does a similar thing for a job because not many people do if you're not overly sure who audio is and I'm sure most of you probably are on this channel I'll link all of his socials below but he also makes Incredible Tech content and I'd really recommend you check it out it's all kind of dark and Moody which is kind of the opposite of what this channel is but the content is fantastic and he's well worth following so I'll link all that below after lunch we had a quick walk around and he showed us some spots in Canary Wharf that he really likes and I also finally showed him the moon Swatch which I'd managed to obtain earlier that week after that we say our goodbyes and as we're in Canary Wharf me and Sam decide to stick around and we use the iPhone to take some more photo and video and to really enjoy it and once again I spend a little bit more time in Lightroom playing around with the photos to see what they look like and the same with the video too some of the things I'm capturing here just looks absolutely awesome on the iPhone and the stabilization as well was just epic so it's nice to spend a little bit of time doing that too once we had our fill of all the views and vistas of Canary Wharf we decided to head off to our next stop which is Saint Dunstan in the East I was kind of excited to visit Saint Dunstan in the East because I'd seen it on Instagram and it's like a really beautiful place it's basically a bombed out Church from World War II which was never kind of rebuilt and kind of Nature's taken back over it but unfortunately when we got there all the plants were kind of dead and it was really quite busy so we don't really spend too much time there other than getting a few quick shots before deciding to head somewhere else our plan earlier in the day was to go on the Emirates cable cars Over the River Thames but unfortunately because it was so windy we thought they might be shut or we might just be really sick if we went on them so I thought we should go to the tape modem which is a huge art building in London which has a viewing deck which is really high up and it would be great to get some photos from so once again taking the tube and a little bit of walking this time too we get to the Tate modern and we start heading upwards in there we get to level five and then suddenly we see that all the levels above that including the viewing platform were shut so without wasting any more time in there we head outside and see the Millennium Bridge which has that classic view of Saint Paul's and I once again stopped for some photos and video on the iPhone which again are just looking really really nice so it was nice to kind of recover from that but it was still not perfect at this point as well I checked my battery on my phone and I'm down to around 35 and this is at about four o'clock in the afternoon so things are getting really low but I am keeping an eye on it and trying to close Google Maps when I remember to despite the day wearing on there was one more stop I wanted to make before we headed back to Paddington to get our train home and this was Finance Muse this is a beautiful little Street in Gloucester Road so once again we take the tube and use a combination of Google Maps and just looking at signs to make sure we know where we're going and it really lived up to the hype I've seen this a lot on Instagram and it's also where they filmed the latest season of you or season 4 of you on Netflix so I kind of wanted to see it for that too but it was really really beautiful I can see why people have a view of London and they just see these because they were beautiful little homes and they're all really cute and cozy so we spend a good bit of time there as we're losing the light taking some more photos taking some more video and just enjoying it as tourists it did make me wish we'd come here around golden hour because it would have been beautiful then but it was still nice to see it and I'm really happy we finally made that final stop after spending as much time there as possible it's actually getting pretty close to when we need to head back to Pennington station to get our train home which was at seven o'clock so once again we head back on the tube and get back to Paddington Station at around quarter past six after picking up some dinner we sit down and I take a little bit more time on the iPhone to edit some photos on Lightroom to post a bunch more on Instagram because I pretty much ignored it all day and to also browse Twitter and talk to some people on WhatsApp too I'm down to around 10 percent of battery at this point which I thought was quite shocking because usually when I'm at home I get to about 75 a day and that's kind of it but it is worth noting that Google Maps has been open pretty much all day I've been taking a bunch of photos a bunch of video been talking to people on the phone and in London at least on the network I'm on 4G and 5G seems to swap around a lot which I know is quite taxing on the battery and that's something I just don't have at home so I get down to around five percent after doing all that and decide to throw it on the anchor mag go charger which I'm actually really happy I brought with me because I've still got a three and a half journey home at this point I wait for the iPhone to charge up a little I burn my mouth on some coffee and then we finally get the train home and pretty much for the entire train home I just listened to Spotify and we talk about the day so that pretty much wraps up a day in the life of the iPhone 14 pro Max when I'm going to London and back in a day I hope you enjoyed this video I had a blast making it so if you did pop a like that'd be awesome and if you could leave a comment below of anywhere else that I should visit in London then do because I love to find out new places and also love to hear what you have to think and of course like always I will see you all in the next one foreign
