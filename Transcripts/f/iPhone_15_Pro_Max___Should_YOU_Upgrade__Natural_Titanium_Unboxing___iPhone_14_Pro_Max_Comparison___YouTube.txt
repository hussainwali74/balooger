[Music] foreign [Music] that is ridiculously silver they're finally here this is the iPhone 15 Pro Max in natural titanium I've also got one of Apple's fine woven cases which I wanted to check out as well and I've also got my iPhone 14 pro Max with me just wanted to check it out against this and just see what the differences are like initially and I've also got some cases sent through from Ander which we'll talk about a little bit later but let's get the studio set up and get this thing unboxed whoa that is ridiculously silver it's actually way more silver than I thought it was gonna be but it's nice it's really nice Apple generally always do a really good job with colors and this kind of natural one is pretty much a bang on a silver color like a really kind of classic silvery gray looks really really nice though sometimes you have to kind of see things in person to really understand what they look like and I definitely think this is one of them it doesn't quite look like it looks like on the website not in a bad way at all probably in a more of a good way it's a actually kind of nicer than I thought it was going to be these rails on the side are way way nicer especially compared to the iPhone 12 13 and 14 these are much much more kind of comfortable anyway let's get this wrapper off oh yeah in the Box you're getting the braided cable nozzer which is pretty nice happy that Apple are doing that still no charger obviously but this is a nicer cable kind of wish it was color matched that would be awesome but hey that's still really nice I can already tell coming from the 14 pro Max that the bezel on this is quite a lot smaller which is awesome it feels a lot nicer as well I've actually got my 14 pro here and you can probably see the difference of how different the kind of stainless steel looks compared to the kind of titanium this is a already really fingerprint either 14 pro Max and this one looks less so but actually they're still coming on pretty quick still quite a lot but yeah much much nicer and a lot less sharp in the hand I actually still think I probably prefer the Deep Purple over the silver and obviously you're going to get the action button now which is on the left side so there's no more mute switch and I guess that's a good thing because most of us probably put this on mute and then never ever take it off so having it back to an action button which you can choose what to do is potentially quite a lot better A lot better for use cases and things like that oh yeah this looks great and let's have a quick look at these bezels actually so you can probably just about see there on the 14 compared to the 15 Pro how much kind of bigger the bezels are that's actually quite surprising it's a it's a same size phone and everything like that and it feels gosh it feels so much lighter even though it's not hugely I don't think it's usually lighter on the specs or anything like that but yeah this is way lighter than this this I've always fought the 14 pro and actually since the 12 Pro have been pretty heavy especially top heavy when you're like using it for one hand but this feels a lot nicer and a lot nicer in the hand overall super super nice and finally one of the big Updates this year was getting USBC across all of the iPhone 15 models and really it's something to be celebrated everybody has been asking for this for the longest time and whether Apple were forced or if they just decided to put it on here it's fantastic to see just means all of your charges and all of your cables can now finally do absolutely everything and honestly it's kind of strange to see USBC on an iPhone but I'm really glad it's here it's long overdue so let's just be happy that they finally done it I actually also have the iPhone 15 in green this is just the standard model and this one's still got the mute switch you can see on the back there the difference in the cameras but the material on the back feels pretty much the same they frosted the glass on the 15 now which is kind of nice it feels good all around but yeah so here's a range as well this is the iPhone 15. this is the iPhone 14 pro Max and this is the iPhone 15 Pro Max it actually looks a little bit smaller overall I think the dimensions are pretty much exactly the same but the way that the corners round off it just makes it look a little bit smaller and definitely feels smaller as well which is kind of awesome I also have Apple's fine woven case here as well this is the one that which has taken over from the leather cases because they're not doing it anymore for kind of environmental reasons and there's been loads of kind of interesting things about this online a lot of people saying it scratches Easy A lot of people saying it's fine so let's unbox this as well see what it's like and see what people have been fussing about okay so this is definitely a fabric case you can tell immediately this is kind of nothing like the level one feels nice enough though let's pop the phone into it oh this looks this is really decent I do quite like it I wouldn't say I absolutely love it and I'll hold it up to the camera here hopefully so you can see it but this is definitely a fabric case it's pretty far off the level they've done before and I know a lot of people have been scratching it with their nail like immediately getting in all sorts of scratches and stuff I'm not going to do that on this video because I'd rather let it wear naturally rather than just kind of scratch it for scratching's sake but yeah this is nice I can see why people would be kind of bummed out that the lever's not around anymore but yeah it's quite nice to the Natural titanium as well this deep blue color it's tasty I quite like it however if you are looking for a actual leather case this time around then I'm really happy to say that the sponsor of today's video and I'll have you sorted out they very kindly sent me out three of their new leather cases so let's check them out I've got the camel tan the jet black and the Blanc version here and these are all really nice to hold in the hand they're actually very reminiscent of Apple's kind of older leather cases these still have the microfiber inside and the magsafe compatibility but these are great obviously the great thing with leather cases is that they're patina really beautifully over time as well which is just really useful for something which sees so much wear and tear this Bonk version is interesting as well because it's actually made from Cactus leather which means it's vegan friendly too andal has a range of other colors for this case as well and they're all really nice they're definitely worth checking out and if you use the code byte review you get a cheeky 15 off too so big thank you to and R4 sponsoring this video obviously another one of the huge upgrades as well was with the cameras especially with the pro Max Series so we're now getting a five times optical zoom which should outclass the 14 pro Max and I'll throw up some pictures so you can see it here but this should give us quite a lot more detail when just zooming in that bit further I'm more interested to see how this will do in a day-to-day sort of scenario so I'm going to test it out loads over the following weeks I'm going to make a day in the lifestyle video with this phone as well so make sure you stick around so you don't miss it but overall do I think this phone is worth upgrading to I don't think the 15 Pro Max is kind of there to convince people from a 13 or even a 14 to upgrade to that's kind of not what Apple's going for here I think if you've got a iPhone 12 or lower this is going to be a fantastic upgrade and you're going to see lots of really worthwhile things like better battery life better performance and better cameras for those people it's going to really feel noticeable but like I said if you're on a 13 or a 14 I would honestly stay there I don't think there's any kind of meaningful reason to upgrade so that rounds up this first look at this iPhone 15 Pro Max I hope you enjoyed the video if you did pop a like and if you picked up an iPhone 15 kind of in any combination let me know in the comments below which one you went for and as always I will see you all in the next one
