The_ULTIMATE_iPadOS_17_Home_Screen_Setup_Guide___YouTube
 
[Music] one of the most useful things I've done with my iPad over the past year or so or maybe even a little bit longer now is to set up different home screens for different use cases I've always found the iPad a bit of a distraction machine there's always an app to check and there's always a notification to respond to and using these different Focus modes really helps when I need to get some proper work done or if I'm doing some research or if I want to just settle down with some games or things like that I've been using a shortcut widget which is on all of my home screens which helps me do this this lets me jump between my general home screen which has all the apps that I need to access kind of all the time it's got a productivity screen which is fantastic for all of my work related things I've also got a gaming one which I don't really use so much anymore but it's still on there and it's still really nice and I also have an iPad control one which means when I connect my iPad to an external monitor to use stage manager this just gives me loads of glanceable information while I've got this connected up to an external monitor I've even got it now so every time I rotate into a different Focus mode the wallpaper changes as well which I really really like you may have seen me use this a lot in previous videos but back then it was really tricky to set up I only had a small tutorial but in this video thanks to iPad f17 as well it's way way easier and I'm going to run you through the entire thing please bear in mind as though you need the iPad OS 17 beta at the moment but the official release of that is literally in a few days time so if you don't have it right now you will soon and then it will make sense this won't work on earlier versions of iPad OS and of course if you do like the wallpapers that are on the iPad at the moment this is a set of my own this is a collaboration with canopy called Elemental if you want to check them out and help support the channel I'll link them below before we do though I did want to talk about the sponsor of this video band work band work are a high quality Apple watch band maker with a dedicated focus on using the best materials and craftsmanship while keeping their prices as Fair as possible and I'm actually really happy to admit I've only been using the standard Apple watch bands of my Apple watch since well pretty much forever but since switching to this g1a metal band from band work I think I'm a total convert this strap is really gorgeous and the black metal flows seamlessly into my Apple watch it's a really nice effect I mostly consider the Apple watch to look sporty so I don't really wear it to specific places or events but with this strap it's a really nice in-between keeping the functionality while looking more professional at the same time they also sent me the Honolulu strap in beige and it's a stunner too and adds another look to the watch I've been ignoring for such a long time what's also nice is you can pick the colors of the clasp and the adapters so you can get the right look for your Apple watch as well it's also nice to know that most of band work straps are handmade in Germany by people who genuinely care about the product so if you want to add a little something to your Apple watch then check them out at the link in the description below and a huge Thanks goes out to bad work for sponsoring this video all right let's get started so the first thing you're going to need to do is to set up each one of your different home screens and don't worry this is really easy just hold your finger on the iPad so it enters into jiggle mode swipe once to the right and then start making all of your different home screens if you're not sure which sort of things to make might be good to have one for work one for gaming maybe if you've got kids it's worth setting up a mode for that so it's just kid based apps on an iPad or anything else that kind of comes to mind the only thing I really recommend you have is making sure you've got the shortcuts widget on each one of your home screens as well this will make switching between them really really easily to add this go back into jiggle mode go to the top left where you can add a widget press the little plus button there and then scroll down until you see the shortcuts one and then you just want to scroll over until you see the one which has got four buttons on it make sure you've got that added into each one of your home screens if you really don't like that widget and don't want it on there you can go to control center at the top right and then tap into which Focus mode that you want to go into but I would honestly recommend not doing that and having it on the home screen just makes the whole thing way easier I really recommend setting up a home screen for just general use as well so this would just be your main one that you have when you come into the iPad then you've always got one which you can come home to if you ever get lost or stuck or anything like that it just kind of resets the entire experience it's really really useful it's worth having after you've made all of your home screens the next thing you're going to want to do is hide them so to do this enter into jiggle mode again press the little page icon on top of the dot then you'll be greeted with a screen where you can select and deselect any pages that you've just made I like to hide all these on my general one you can kind of pick what you'd like to see but for this to work kind of nicely and properly I recommend hiding all of them apart from your general one here next up we need to make sure the wallpaper changes each time that you enter a different Focus mode you don't have to do this if you don't want to if you want to keep your wallpaper consistent but I find it's like a really nice kind of visual cue that you're in a different mode so I'd recommend setting it up to do this it's just basically setting up a new wallpaper so it's really easy if you go to your lock screen hold your finger on the iPad and then swipe and make as many lock screens as you like each of that different wallpaper which is going to relate to your focus mode you can even change the widgets on the side here and the style of clock so for my gaming one I've got some more battery level things on the side and the clock looks a little bit more gamer and I've done something similar for my productivity setup as well which includes a to-do list and the news and other little things like that it's worth spending some time here to make them look really nice just make sure that you've got one of these for each of your focus modes and then after that jump back to the home screen moving on from there we're going to need to set up the focus modes in settings so your iPad has something to jump to each time so head into the settings app and on the left hand side scroll down until you see Focus tap that and the first thing you're going to want to do here is untick the section which says share between devices if you don't every time you change something on your iPad it will change on your phone and your Mac and everything else is really really frustrating so just make sure that one's turned off before you get started we're going to want to set up a focus mode for each of the home screens we've made so go to the top right where you see a little plus and hit that your iPad will give you some suggestions of ones you can use you can hit one of those if you'd like to or you can just press create custom and go from there I'm going to create a custom one so hit custom and then pick an icon and color which kind of makes sense and you should be able to name it here too you'll then be brought into the customization area for your focus mode and by default it silences notifications and things like that but you can allow some apps and some people through so if you want to do that you can press here at the top and then change around what you need to but the most important thing for us here is the customize screens menu first up if you pick the lock screen that you want first to relate to this Focus mode so if I'm making a productivity one for instance I know that that's the green lock screen so I'm going to press the green lock screen and then I'm going to press the one on the right and that's going to let me pick which home screen show up so I'm going to pick the productivity one that I made but you can select anyone here that you've made that you want to relate to this home screen the that's the main thing you need to do there are some other options you can play around with but after you've done that you need to do exactly the same thing for each one of your other Focus modes moving on and you'll be happy there's not much longer to go now we need to set up the shortcut widget so you can press that button and switch between all these Focus modes really quickly and luckily it's nice and easy to do to do this you're going to want to go into your shortcuts app that should be on your iPad already but if you can't find it swipe down and type in shortcuts and it should be the first one that pops up at the top right of the screen near the search bar you're going to see a little plus icon if you tap that one it will let you create a new shortcut and off the bat this screen will look really scary and complicated but honestly there's not much to it it's nice and simple to use when you're in there on the right hand side there's a little search bar if you type into their focus you'll see something on the right pop-up called set Focus mode and all you need to do is tap that you'll see it pop up to the top of the screen there and all you want to do is where it says do not disturb tap that and change that to one of the new Focus modes you've just made after you've selected your focus mode if you tap the little off button next to it it will say on until turned off that's all you need to do once you've done that you can rename the focus thing to your new Focus mode which you should absolutely do so tap that at the top left and then you can rename it and you can also give it an icon and a color which is totally worth doing once you're back on this screen you need to go back to that plus menu and do the same thing for each of your other Focus modes so by the end of it you should have something which looks like this finally while we're in the shortcuts app there's one more button we need to set up and this is going to be a home one this will deactivate all of your focus modes and bring your iPad back to that standard home screen for General everyday use this is going to be a similar process as before so press that plus icon and then once again on the right hand side type in focus and then press the option for set focus and then once that pops up to the top of the screen we're just going to want to make sure that it turns off every single Focus so to do this tap do not disturb again and change that to one of your focus ones and change it to off so you should be able to just leave it and then you should be able to add this again for each one of your focus modes I recommend doing this for every single Focus mode just so you can turn them all off at once and again once you're done it should look something like this and the last command we're going to need to give this home button is to bring us right back home after turning off all of those Focus icons so in the search bar again type in set wallpaper and it should pop up down the bottom here tap that and then set your general home screen for your standard iPad use you'll want to name this final shortcut home and give it a nice icon and color as well and then going back to your shortcuts home screen it should look something like this okay so now we should be completely sorted with the entire thing and you'll find that your shortcuts widget on your home screens is now populated with those buttons so you should be able to jump between all of your new Focus modes nice and easily now if you're setting up more Focus modes in three or four and you want more options you can make a bigger widget and do the same process again and just have a larger widget on each of your home screens but for me I like to keep it nice and simple just to jump between these three modes I found really really useful there is a ton of flexibility in this so if you found an easier way of doing it or if you found something else which is really really useful that kind of should be built into this do let us know in the comments below because it's always good to learn new stuff while I'm making these videos but there you have it you should now be able to have a fully professional completely customized home screen experience for your iPad which should completely speed up your use it's helped me loads it's actually let me get a lot more work done on my iPad and hopefully it will for you as well I've got loads of other iPad related videos on this channel so if you want to check them out I'll link those below but check out the rest of the channel to and as always I'll see you all in the next one
