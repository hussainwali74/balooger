- Today we're gonna fly through a list of 30 back-to-school items. Some're gonna be for productivity some're gonna be for fun. We're gonna go fast, so for most of the items I'll show you one or two examples. Then there'll be some other options listed in the description. So let's get started with a fun item. This's a gaming pillow from Valari. And at first I wasn't sure that I would like it, but it has absolutely been a game changer. You see what I did there? It puts me in a much more comfortable position when I'm gaming, my neck doesn't hurt as much, and my elbows are always supported. So I would highly recommend that you check one out. Next on the list is a good pair of earbuds, and there're a ton of great options at various price points. And for me, the most important thing is comfort. Audio quality, battery life, and even water resistance don't mean anything if the earbuds hurt your ears. So make sure that you first find a pair that's comfortable and then look at the other features. I use AirPods a lot of the time 'cause they fit my ears really well, but the one thing that really bothers me is how slippery the case is. There's so many times they just fall out on the couch or in the car and then I have to spend all day trying to find them, which's why I always add a case. Here're a couple of options from ESR, the Orbit and the Cyber Armor. Both add plenty of grippiness so the case's no longer slippery. On top of that, I'm getting additional protection and they're both MagSafe compatible, so they snap onto my charger while my AirPods wirelessly charge. If you don't like earbuds or if you wanna block out the distractions, get yourself a good pair of noise-canceling, over-the-ear headphones. Again, there's a ton of options at various price points, and usually the higher-end ones offer a better combination of audio quality and noise cancellation. But you'd be surprised at what you can get even with a budget option. Next, you may wanna consider a laptop. Now, you're gonna want something that's comfortable to type on, supports all the apps that you need, is powerful enough to last you at least for the next four years, and has great battery life. Keep in mind that this is a portable device, so you wanna make sure that you're not getting something that's too bulky, unless it's the only way to get the performance that you need. To be perfectly honest I'm not always super careful with my laptops, which is why I started adding a protective case. It does add to the size, but I'm so much less worried about scratches or even something worse happening to them. Another item to consider is a sit/stand desk. We spend so much of our time at our desk sitting in the same position all day, and regardless of how comfortable the chair is sitting all day is not the best option. I've been using sit/stand desks for years, now. I change between sitting down and standing up throughout the day, and for me, there's no going back. Now, I don't know about you but I'm always charging more than one device at a time, which is why I pretty much never use the charger that comes with my phone or tablet. And instead, I use a multi-port charger. I like ones that have a high capacity, a combination of USB-A and USB-C ports, so I can charge all my accessories at once. And the more ports the better. Another option to consider, especially if you're in the Apple ecosystem, is a three-in-one charger for your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. It saves me a ton of space and I don't have three cables on my desk. When I'm on the go, I always have a power bank with me. And again, I want high capacity and multiple ports so I can easily charge my more demanding devices like my laptop, and I can charge multiple devices at once. I'll put some links in the description to a few of my favorites to help you choose. I also use this kickstand wireless power bank for my iPhone. There're both five- and 10,000-milliamp-per-hour capacity options, which is plenty to last me all day. It's MagSafe compatible so it snaps onto my phone, it has a kickstand so I can always have my phone at a comfortable viewing angle, and I can use the USB-C port to charge another device. Now let's talk about a few smart accessories that can help you out, starting with a smartwatch. The one you choose is very likely to depend on the ecosystem that you're currently in, but it's a great way to keep up with reminders and notifications as well as track your fitness and sleep habits. Another item you may wanna add to your room is a smart speaker. It won't only tell you what the weather is going to be like, keep track of timers, and then answer random questions that you may need for school, but it'll also give you better audio than your mobile devices. And speaking of better audio, I just got the new Sony HT-AX7, which is like a portable theater system with 360 spatial sound mapping. This thing is awesome. You got a base unit and then two wireless satellite speakers which you can place behind you and to the side. And it will absolutely transform the viewing experience on your phone, tablet, or laptop. It's definitely not a budget item but I love the combination of convenience, audio quality, and the overall experience. So if you get a chance to check one out, go for it. Now, we talked about laptops earlier but if you don't need all the functionality of a laptop a tablet may be a better option. You can get some really good options at lower price points and you can use them for watching content, gaming, surfing the web, and even school video calls. Now, regardless of which tablet you get you'll wanna get a protective case. And right now, for my 11-inch iPad Pro I'm using the Shift's magnetic case. It has a really nice faux-leather finish; it protects the front, back, sides, and the corners; I can adjust the angle of the iPad for viewing; and I can even remove the iPad from the main cover when I want a more slim solution while still protecting the back. It also has a spot for the second-generation Apple Pencil so I don't have to worry about losing it in my bag. And speaking of Apple Pencil, if you wanna get more out of your tablet you're probably gonna wanna pick up some accessories. So Apple offers their own accessories like the Magic Keyboard, the Magic Keyboard Folio, and both generation Apple pencils. I have all of them, and they're great products if they fit your budget. If you're looking for a similar functionality at a lower price point you can check out their Rebound magnetic keyboard case, which has a keyboard and track pad and it supports multitouch gestures and keyboard shortcuts. For the second-generation Apple Pencil alternative check out the digital pencil. It has a very similar feel and form factor, tilt sensitivity, palm rejection, magnetic attachment, and long battery life for a fraction of the price. Now, with all the projects that you'll have going for school you may wanna consider getting an external SSD. This way you don't have to spend as much money on internal storage for your laptop or tablet and you can share one external SSD with multiple devices. Now let's talk about another fun item, an electric scooter. Whether you need to get to or from class, you just need to get around campus, or you're going to visit a friend, an electric scooter is such a fun item. Make sure that you get one that is sturdy, has solid brakes and good battery life, and always wear a helmet in case you fall. And speaking of accidents, we talked about protective cases for your laptop and tablets but you should also consider protecting the screens. For your tablet you can choose a clear screen protector or a paper-like one if you like to draw and take handwritten notes. For my laptop I'm using a magnetic option that doesn't only protect my screen from being damaged, it also protects my privacy. Now, back to your desk setup. I've always found that multiple monitors help me be more productive. And it doesn't matter if I'm doing research, working on a website, or editing videos, I can always use multiple monitors. Now, I may have gone overboard with my main workstation but at least consider getting a second monitor to work with. Some laptops don't support multiple monitors or they have limited ports, and that's where you'll wanna think about adding a hub. A good hub should give you all the ports that you need and support the number of external displays that you wanna use. So check out the description for some great options. Now, there're a few other items that will help make your desktop setup better, starting with a mechanical keyboard. Now, I absolutely love the sound and feel that I can get, and it's great that every user can pick exactly what they want. Of course, you can also choose a hot swappable option in case you change your mind. Something else that I super recommend you look into is a great mouse. It's an accessory that you use use so much, so whether you want the best ergonomics or improved performance for gaming, it's just something that you'll appreciate every day. Another item that I add to almost every desktop setup is a nice set of speakers. Now, these're the Audioengine A2+, I have them on two of my setups. They gimme good audio quality, they aren't super expensive, and I love the clean look. And speaking of audio, if you do a lot of video calls, if you're gaming, and definitely if you're streaming, do yourself a favor and get a dedicated microphone. There are a ton of great options going from USB to XLR, and they all sound better than using the microphone on your device. The next item is something that I always have around for when I need a break, and that's a Rubik's cube. It's super fun, it gives me a break from tech, and I also use it when I get stuck with a creative or technical problem and I need to get my brain to forget about it while it focuses on something else. I can solve it in under a minute, but I'm not super fast like those speed cubers that you see. The next item on my list is something that I didn't think I needed until I got it, and I'm talking about a tech accessory bag. This's the one that I use with my tablets and it protects my tablet from being damaged, it has a place for all my accessories, and it keeps my accessories separate from my tablet so it doesn't get damaged.
