last year i read a book that had a tremendous impact on how i organized my life it's called work clean by dan charnes and it introduced me to mies on plus a system for cooking used by professional chefs in restaurants around the world it was actually created in the 1800s starting in the 1800s in france using techniques borrowed from the military and its purpose was to make cooking both better and faster see professional chefs they only have so much energy and time as they work in the kitchen they have to produce a constant steady stream of outputs which is prepared meals but they have to do that not just fast those meals have to be at a very high standard of quality just one undercooked fillet can mean the whole plate is sent back to the kitchen so if you think about it your work and mine is probably very similar we likewise have to generate a steady stream of outputs here are four powerful practices we can borrow from the practice of mise-en-place and how dan charnes's book applies to those of us producing modern creative work [Music] there are four practices that mison plus has to offer us let's cover them one at a time first decide the order of operations second distinguish between background tasks and immersive tasks third use placeholders to remember things and fourth adopt a finishing mindset the first key practice from mison plus is to decide the order of operations see in a kitchen the order of operations the order in which you do things is everything the meat obviously can't go on the chopping block if it's frozen the pasta won't absorb the sauce unless it's been cooked the garlic can't be added to the dish until it's been chopped but it's funny when it comes to our personal productivity it's much less clear in which order we should do things does it really matter if you send that email first or write that report first how can we really know everything feels like it's top priority everything feels like it should be happening right now all at the same time what the kitchen teaches us is that that's false early actions are much more important than later ones the first tasks that you take on a project for example are just more impactful than later ones because they determine which direction the project goes the first actions you take early in the day have a much bigger impact than the ones you take later in the day because they determine your energy level and your state of mind and how much time you have throughout the rest of the day what this means is we should pay far more attention to the first tasks on our to-do list rather than the later ones a minute spent at the beginning of your week to just go over your top priorities could easily save you hours later on in the week an hour spent each month reviewing your longer term goals might save you weeks or even months of unfocused effort over the course of a year i want you to pay attention not only to what goes on your to-do list but to the precise order in which you complete those to-do's so now you're probably wondering what kinds of tasks should i start with this brings us to our second principle chefs distinguish between two very different kinds of culinary tasks background tasks versus immersive tasks immersive tasks require the chef's full focus their full attention things like stirring sauteing mincing or seasoning a dish background tasks on the other hand can happen without the chef's attention they happen in the background such as broiling marinating and boiling these have to be started by a human but after that they can progress on their own it's critically important to perform background tasks before doing immersive tasks why because if you do those background tasks they have time to finish while you're doing other more active things have you ever prepared an entire meal i've done this dozens of times prepared an entire meal and only then at the very end realized that you never started making the rice every time i do this i have to wait another 20 or 30 minutes while the rice is cooking while all the rest of the food gets cold in the kitchen it's obviously a much better idea to start the rice first and then do other things while the rice is cooking but here's the funny thing it's so obvious in the kitchen but as knowledge workers we barely recognize the difference when we encounter these two different kinds of tasks not just that we often overvalue immersive tasks there's a trend to call them deep work which implies that deeply immersive tasks are the best most important kind of work when in fact it's actually background tasks that can create more value than you can produce on your own ask yourself what are some small tasks i can take now to begin unlocking the value while i attend to other things in the meantime if you email your team in the morning with an agenda for an afternoon meeting they'll have time until then to think about and prepare their own notes so by the time that meeting comes around it's more productive if you publish a how-to document teaching your team how to accomplish a task that you normally perform they can get to work on it while you focus on other things i know these might not seem like especially important actions they take just a few minutes but consider this the larger network that you're a part of the network of devices and technology and software the network of the internet the collective effort of that network is always going to vastly outweigh what you can accomplish by yourself if you take actions background tasks to get them started while you work on other things that whole system the whole system that goes beyond just you can move forward while you complete your deep work all of this begins with learning to make the distinction between background tasks and immersive tasks in your life principle number three is to use placeholders to remember what's important think about what happens in a busy restaurant when a chef receives multiple requests multiple orders all at once how in the world is she supposed to remember all the precise details and all the substitutions and all the requests for multiple orders all in her own head the way that she does this is she externalizes she offloads those orders into her surroundings using what are called placeholders for example placing a pan on the stovetop for preheating is a placeholder setting a bunch of parsley on the cutting board is a placeholder each of these physical objects represents the starting point for a whole series of actions that she'll need to take and this is the cool thing she can recall all the different tasks that she has in progress by just glancing around her surroundings now think about your own situation i'm guessing you probably receive many times more requests more demands on your time than you can fulfill right away right every single message every notification every reminder is actually a request for your limited attention you can use the same kinds of placeholders as chefs you can also externalize what are called open loops open loops are unfinished mental tasks that keep taking up your mind space and driving you a little crazy you can externalize and offload those open loops from your mind into your environment so you don't have to remember them since so much of knowledge work is digital it makes sense that our placeholders are also digital this is how you do it every time a new input arrives you should immediately externalize it add an appointment to your calendar capture an open loop in your task manager create a digital note and jot down that thought or bookmark save a piece of content that you want to read later you can refuse to use your mind as the storage medium for everything you have to do and remember this will ensure that your mind your own limited memory is never the bottleneck on your productivity or your output principle number four adopt a finishing mindset in cooking a dish that is 99 finished has zero value just think about it chefs don't get partial credit either the dish is delivered steaming hot to the correct customer or it's worth nothing and it goes into the trash spaghetti without sauce doesn't get rated a 9 out of 10 just because it's missing only one element because of this really brutal reality chefs have adopted what's called a finishing mindset first they don't start anything they can't finish there's no point but once they do start a dish they are fiercely determined to see it through to completion because they know that if they don't all the effort and the time that went into it will be wasted as knowledge workers we can benefit so much from a finishing mindset until you deliver a tangible piece of work a tangible deliverable no value has been created no lessons have been learned no feedback has been received no profit has been realized and i know it often feels like we can put whatever we're working on aside and just get to it later but i think most people don't realize there's very real cost to doing that whatever you push aside continues to take up your mental bandwidth it continues circling around and around your head until it gets finished when you start too many things without finishing them the burden of keeping all those balls in the air can eventually grind your progress to a complete halt you can actually reach the point where you are spending all your time just updating and reviewing and you have no time left over to actually move things forward the very best way that i know of to reduce that mental overload is to close loops for every task that you're executing just ask yourself how and when will i finish this don't just make a plan to start things anyone can do that make a plan for finishing things that is what sets you apart sometimes one phone call can completely derail your entire day but even in those cases you can still have a finishing mindset as an example instead of dropping one task like it's hot and immediately turning to another take just a few moments to tie up what you're working on write down an open loop in your task manager you know i find most people focus way too much attention on starting new things but let me tell you if you can become a finisher if you can become someone who knows how to finish things you will stand out from the crowd working clean's most important point to me is that all this space the physical space all around us and the digital environment that we work in it has a certain kind of intelligence space can remember things it can remind you of things it can keep track of things for you if you can learn to unlock the power of space you'll have a way to process information without using any energy we never get that chance to arrange our workspace in a way that supports and encourages focus now here's the thing here's the silver lining because our work is mostly digital what we can control is our digital workspace we can curate we can design we can order our virtual environment to provide a sense of predictability and consistency it can look like using a digital notes app as the default place where any new thought or any new idea always goes it can include creating a dedicated place to store all the information related to your projects each of these tools and routines reinforces a state of mind that you want to protect and promote in your life one of my favorite quotes is from french novelist gustav flaubert since we're on the french theme today he said be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work i'm going to modify that quote a little bit my advice is to be regular and orderly in your routines so you can be violently original in your creativity working clean in your daily life like a michelin star chef is one of the best routes that i've found to violently original profoundly creative work [Music] you
