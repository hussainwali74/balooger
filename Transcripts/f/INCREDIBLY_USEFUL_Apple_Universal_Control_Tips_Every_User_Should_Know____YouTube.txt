INCREDIBLY_USEFUL_Apple_Universal_Control_Tips_Every_User_Should_Know____YouTube
 
- Did you know that you can use a single keyboard and mouse or even your iPad's magic keyboard to control up to three Apple devices? It's called Universal Control. It's an incredible feature, and this is how it works. And by the way, I also added a troubleshooting section at the end if you run into any problems. All right, so starting out on your Mac or MacBook click on the Apple Menu, then System Settings or System Preferences, and click on Displays from the menu on the left. As long as you're using macOS Ventura or later click on the Advance button on the bottom right of the settings window, and then in the link to iPad or Mac section, turn on, Allow your pointer and keyboard to move between any nearby Mac or iPad. Now, there are two other settings there and most of you are gonna wanna leave those turned on. The first is push through the edge of the display to connect to a nearby Mac or iPad, and I'll show you what that does in just a moment. And the second setting is to automatically reconnect to any nearby Mac or iPad. Now, I leave this one on but if you don't want that to happen of course you can disable it. Alright, so that takes care of any Mac or MacBooks that you have. So now let's move on to your iPad. Now, go ahead and open the Settings app, tap on General and then Airplay &amp; Handoff. And then enable Cursor and Keyboard. This setting is only available on iPad models that support Universal Control. So if you don't see that option, you'll need to use one of the supported iPads and make sure that you're using iPad OS 15.4 or later. All right, so now you've done all the hard part and it's time to have fun. So all you need to do is put your devices near each other and make sure that they're awake and unlocked. You can use your mouse or the track pad to move the pointer past the left or right edge of the current device somewhere in the general direction of the iPad or the other Mac. You'll see that when you get past the edge of your current screen, the other device will show a bar with a pointer pushing through the screen and you'll get a little bit of resistance. So keep pushing it all the way through, and then that's it. You're good to go. Now, as you continue to go back and forth between the different displays you don't have to deal with this small barrier every time. It's gonna work just like every other typical multi-display setup. And speaking of multiple displays, you might run into a situation where your monitors aren't automatically arranged in macOS like they are in real life and that makes it harder to navigate between devices. So what I want you to do is go to your primary Mac, click on the Apple menu and then System Settings or again, or System Preferences, click on Displays and then click the Arrange button. You'll see the Arrange Displays window pop up and then you can click and drag each display to reflect the actual configuration that you have in real life. All right, so now you can use your MacBook keyboard and track pad, you can use your dedicated keyboard and mouse even the magic keyboard to control every device. They all actually work at the same time. So if you're working on an external keyboard or mouse, then you happen to reach for your MacBook or iPad you won't have any issues. And as you continue to use this, I want to talk about a few features that are unique to the iPad. The pointer actually becomes a dot which represents your finger and you can use it to touch or to touch and hold. You can also use most of the track pad gestures on the iPad. So for example, you can swipe with two fingers to go between pages on the home screen. If you're in an app, you can move the pointer past the bottom of the screen to open the dock. If you wanna bring up control center on your iPad, you can click the status icons on the top right corner of the screen. Or you can click on the time and date on the upper left corner to open Notification Center. And of course, you can bring up Spotlight Search by swiping down with two fingers. Now there are a ton of these and I'm actually working on a dedicated video which I'll link to in the description when it's published. But now I want to talk about how to drag and drop between devices. So for example, you can sketch on your iPad with the Apple Pencil and then use your mouse or track pad to drag the drawing into a keynote presentation on your Mac. You can also do things like drag a photo from your Mac into a conversation and messages on your iPad. Or you can drag files from one Mac to another Mac or even into the Files app on the iPad. And this way they'll be available to any iPad app that supports them. So for example, if I take a screen recording on my MacBook but I want it on my iPad Pro because I want it in a LumaFusion project that I'm working on. I can just drag and drop it exactly where I want to in my Files app instead of using AirDrop. Now, if you try to drop a file in an area where it's not allowed, you'll get the prohibitory symbol but you may still be able to copy and paste it using Command + C to copy and Command + V to paste. Now, if you want to disconnect a device, you can either put it to sleep or on your Mac, you can click on Control Center, then Display, and then click on the Device Name in the Link Keyboard and Mouse section. If you want a shortcut to disconnect all the devices, press Ctrl + Option + Command + Delete on your keyboard, but you might need a couple of your friends to help you press all these buttons at the same time. All right, now let's talk about some requirements that you need in order to get everything to work. First of all, all your devices must be supported and here's a list of devices that are currently supported and I'll put a link in the description which I can update with future changes. Next, every device must be signed in using the same Apple ID and using two factor authentication. Your Macs must be running macOS Monterey 12.4 or later and your iPad must be using iPad OS 15.4 or later. Now, in terms of distance, your devices must be within 30 feet or 10 meters of each other and they need to have Bluetooth, wifi, and Handoff turned on. Also, make sure that your iPad is not sharing its cellular connection and that your Mac is not sharing its internet connection. If you still run into issues, and this has happened to me, put your devices to sleep and then wake them back up. Now as a last resort, and I did have to do this once, turn off Universal Control on every device, restart them all and then turn Universal Control back on.
