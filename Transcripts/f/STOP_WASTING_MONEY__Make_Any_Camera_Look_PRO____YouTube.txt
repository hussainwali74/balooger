- These three clips were shot with a professional camera, an entry-level mirrorless camera, and the latest iPhone. And they all suck, because if you don't have the proper lighting it doesn't matter how much money you spend on your camera, your lenses, or the latest and greatest phone, your footage simply isn't going to look its best. But the good news is the lighting is super simple and you can get your video to look great, whether you have one, two, or three lights, which is called three-point lighting. That's what I'm using here. And the first thing you wanna do is turn off every light in the room, you want complete control. And I added background lighting so you can more easily see the separation. Now it's time to add a key light, which is going to be the primary source of lighting for your subject. There are a lot of great lights in the market with different features and at different price points, but today we're going to use the Zhiyun Molus G200, and thank you to Zhiyun for sending us these lights and for sponsoring this video. So in terms of the position of the key light, I like to have it somewhere between 30 and 45 degrees to my right or camera left, and the exact angle really depends on how much of the face you want the key lights to hit. Now the moles G200 is c COB or COB light, which stands for Chip on Board, and when you look at the light itself you can see that the chip is relatively small, but don't be fooled, it's so bright that you can't even look straight at it when it's at 1%. So what I did in order to create a much larger light source is add a parabolic softbox. Now this particular one is 35 inches or 90 centimeters, and the larger I can make it and the more diffused it is the softer and more pleasing it's going to look. Now I really like how small the Molus G200 is, it doesn't take up a lot of space and it's also super lightweight, and when I'm really tight on space I could select an even smaller parabolic softbox. If you wanna control how much light spills out into the room, you can add a grid to the softbox, and it makes the light much more directional. On the other hand, if you really wanna light up the entire room with one light, then you can use a lantern modifier which spreads the light out. With a parabolic softbox, I like to get the light as close to the subject as possible without it being in the shot, again because the closer I can get the light to the subject the larger it is in relation to the subject, and the softer it ends up looking. Now of course, moving the light closer and farther away from the subject also impacts the intensity, so I always wanna use a light that has a dimmer. This way I can position the light exactly where I want, and then I can increase or decrease the intensity as much as I need to. So the G200 actually goes up to 200 watts under normal usage, which is extremely bright and it's much more than I would ever need in such a controlled environment, but it also makes it super versatile because if I'm shooting in a room where there's a window or some other source of light that I can't control, I always have that additional power to get the perfect exposure. And if you really need to go crazy, there's a max extreme mode on this light that for a limited time will go all the way up to 300 watt output, which is absolutely bananas. Now another important aspect of lighting is the color of the light, which is something that we don't typically think about because our brain does all the work for us as we walk around, and everything always looks normal. But actually different lights have different colors, and if you ever look at your photos or your videos and you're thinking, "Why does everything look orange or blue?" It's because the white balance on the camera didn't match the color of the light that you used. Now, if you light lets you control the color temperature of the light, you can just set your camera's white balance to the same kelvin temperature. And if it doesn't, then you'll need to use a gray card or another method to get the right white balance. Now the last thing to think about is the height of the light, and I'll actually use a smaller light to demonstrate this, and this is the Molus X100. So first, we don't want the key lights to be too high. If the light is much higher than the face, then we're going to start seeing dark shadows under the brow line and the nose. You'll hear people call these raccoon eyes, and it's definitely not something that you want. The next issue comes from the key light being too low and pointing up. Now, because typical light sources like the sun or even the lighting in our homes comes from above, a key light that's placed too low creates a very unnatural look or something that you'd see in a horror movie. So make sure that you're placing your key light just slightly above eye level for the best results, and, of course, the bigger and softer your light is the more room for error there is with placement, because the light wraps around the face. Okay, so that was the key light, let's move on to the fill light. Now, depending on the position and the size of your key light, the opposite side of the face may be too dark. Now this is a stylistic choice so there's really no right or wrong here, you get to pick what you like. A fill light is a light that's pointed at your subject from the opposite side of the camera, so if your key light is on your right then your fill light is going to be on the left. And the fill light is used to fill in some of the shadows that are created by the key light, but the intensity of the fill light will depend on the look that you're trying to achieve. I like to have just enough fill light to show more details, but not so much that the face loses dimension. If you add too much fill light, now you're matching the intensity of the key light and you'll get a more flat look. Now, for this particular shot I used another Molus G200 with a smaller parabolic softbox, and at a much lower intensity. Now one more tip that I wanna give you is that if you only have one light but you still wanna add some fill, you can just use a reflector to bounce some of the key lights back onto the face. And you can move the reflector closer or farther away from the subject to increase or decrease the amount of fill. Okay, so we have a key light and we have a fill light but we wanna separate the subject from the background a little bit, and for this we're going to add a third light which is called the back light, or the rim light, or a hair light. The third light is positioned behind the subject and to the side. Personally, I like to have the rim light opposite the key light and if I only have two lights, sometimes I just do a key light and a rim light, so that way I can add dimension to the subject and I can create a highlight on the opposite side of the face. It also separates the subject from the background by lighting the subject's hair, shoulder, and arm. I'm using a third Molus G200 here but you can use a smaller or less powerful light, and if you wanna stick with the same brand, the Molus G60 and the X100 are even smaller; and the X 100 actually has a battery grip which is super convenient if you need a portable and wireless light source. Again, it's nice to have a light with a dimmer so you don't blow out the highlights that you've created, and make sure that you're not pointing the rim light directly into the camera, because that's going to create a flare which is gonna ruin your shot. Okay, so now let's see what each light looks like on its own, and then how this whole setup comes together on a professional camera, on an entry level camera, and on the iPhone. And I'll have links in the description to the G200 and all the other products that I mentioned. By the way, for this setup, and really for any setup, it's great if your lights use an app. This way you don't need to get up and change the light manually, you can just control everything from one place. First, we'll start with a key light. You can see that it's properly lighting our subject, it's wrapping around the side of the face, it's creating a soft and pleasant look. Next, let's look at just the fill. You can see that it's a lot less intense than the key light was, and it will just help us soften the shadows on the opposite side. Finally, let's look at the back light. You can see that it creates a highlight on the side opposite the key, it also adds a nice effect to the outline of the subject. So here we are with nothing lighting the subject and we're going to go ahead and add the key light, (gentle upbeat music) then the fill light, (gentle upbeat music) and finally the rim light. (gentle upbeat music) And now in the opposite direction let's start with the rim light, add the fill, (gentle upbeat music) and finally the key. (gentle upbeat music) And remember that I mentioned that if I only have two lights, sometimes I just go with a key light and a rim light. Now here the before and after with the professional camera, the entry-level mirrorless camera, and the iPhone. Let me know if you have any questions, hopefully this video is helpful. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice. Good luck, and see you soon.
