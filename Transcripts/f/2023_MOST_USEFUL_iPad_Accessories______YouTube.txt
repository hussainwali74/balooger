- If you wanna get the most out of your new iPad, you need to check out some of these accessories. And spoiler alert, the second to last one might be my favorite, but it's gonna be a close call between that one and the last one. Alright, so first of all, iPads are not cheap, and I have zero trust in my ability to keep one safe. So the first thing I do with every iPad is get a case. But this year, I didn't want just any case, because I wanted full protection when I travel and when I store it. But at the same time, I wanted a more streamlined option when I'm working around the house. So right now, I'm using the tomtoc Detachable Ultra Case, has an awesome cover with a really nice feel. It's got a great texture to it. It fully protects the front, the back, and all four sides, which is super important to me, has reinforced airbag corners, which had a ton of protection. And there's a slot and a strap for the Apple pencil so it doesn't go flying in my bag. But my favorite part is that you can remove the cover and then use the more slim case for when you want something lighter, and you don't need to protect the front. More on this later. Next, I always wanna add a gaming controller because I love using my iPads with the Xbox Game Pass app. There's a ton of compatible options, and if you ever want a controller that no one else has, check out ColorWare, which can design your accessories with your choice of colors or logos. Next, if you don't have a case, or if your case doesn't allow you to change the angle, you need something to help prop your iPad. If you want a great simple solution, get yourself a stand like this one. It's solid, it's completely adjustable, and it lets you position the iPad in just a right angle for you. There are a ton of great options at different sizes, and I'll link to a few in the description. With new features like Stage Manager, I like to expand the functionality of my iPad. If you want something compact, get yourself a USB-C hub. They give you things like a USB-C port for charging, USB port for compatibility with older accessories, an HDMI port if you wanna use an external display, and then even a headphone jack so you can use a wired headphone or headset for gaming. My more advanced option is the stand hub for the iPad. This props the iPad, and with the attached USB-C cable, it gives me an HDMI out, a USB-A port, a USB-C port, a headphone jack, plus SD and microSD card slots. I like that I can both add this functionality and the fact that the cables or accessories are no longer hanging off the side of my iPad. Now, if you happen to have an iPad Pro or an iPad Air 5 and you really wanna go all out, you gotta check out the Kensington StudioDock. This thing is amazing. It magnetically attaches to your iPad. It charges your iPad. It has a wireless charging pad for your iPhone and AirPods, has a fast SD card reader, a USB-C port, three USB-A ports, a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, and a gigabit ethernet port. On top of that, the stand is extremely sturdy, and it rotates and tilts so you can always have the iPad at the angle that you want. Next, if you have kids, or if you're like me and you're just not super careful with your iPad, you may wanna add a screen protector. Now, there are two major types. The first one is clear, which is great if you just want protection, and the other one is paper-like for when you want a better writing or drawing experience, and you want your iPad to feel more like a sheet of paper. Now, when you're choosing an iPad and you get to the part where you have to choose how much storage you need, you pretty quickly realize that adding storage isn't cheap. So what I like to do is get as much storage as I need for apps and local files, and then I use an external SSD for everything else. Now, these things are tiny. They have a ton of space in. For a fraction of the cost, I can add two terabytes or even more. And another great advantage is that I can share this storage with all my other devices. Another important accessory is a keyboard case. Apple makes the Magic Keyboard, the Magic Keyboard Folio, and the smart keyboard. And there are some great third-party options. Now, I don't really like the smart keyboard for the older iPad, so I end up using the Slim Folio from Logitech. It's much more sturdy, it protects the iPad, and it has function keys. Now, the Magic Keyboard probably has the best keys and definitely has the best track pad of any keyboard case that I use. I also love the fact that it has a USB-C pass-through, so I can charge the iPad and still connect an accessory. Now, the Magic Keyboard Folio is a really great option because it has the same quality keys and track pad as the Magic Keyboard, but I can also separate the keyboard from the back cover for when I just need a stand. And again, there are some great options from Logitech and ESR, so I'll include those in the description. Now, if I want the best typing experience, then I'm always going to opt for a mechanical keyboard because I can choose exactly what I want in terms of sound and feel. This particular one is from Keychron, and you can choose between clicky or non-clicky keys and the amount of tactile feedback that you want. I might be super weird, but the sound of typing is one of my favorite sounds. (keyboard clicking) I dunno, for some reason, I find it very soothing. Now, a lot of these keyboards also let you pair them with up to three devices so you can quickly switch from your iPad to your main workstation. And speaking of that, if you want an even more complete desktop-like setup, go ahead and get yourself a mouse. My favorite mouse right now is the Logitech MX Master 3S. I've been using this lineup of mice for like 12 years now, I think, since the Performance MX. And what I really love about the MX Master 3S is that it's super comfortable. It has a ton of extra buttons, a couple of scrollers, and it really helps with my productivity. Also, if you wanna save some money, you can pick up the previous generation one, and it's still incredible. If you prefer a smaller, more portable and less expensive mouse, then go ahead and check out the Logitech M350, which is also known as the Pebble. Now, if you've seen my battery drain test for the iPads, you know that I don't like worrying about running out of battery, which is why I use the next two items from Ugreen. So the first is the Nexode 200-watt charger, and it comes with a power cable so I can run it to my desk, gives me four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. So for me, that means that I only need one charger on my desk, and I can charge my MacBook, my iPad, my iPhone, my Apple Watch, AirPods, and whatever Android phone I'm using at the time. It's super powerful, so it can even charge my 16-inch MacBook Pro in just an hour and a half. And it uses dual GaN chips, so it always stays cool, and I know that my expensive devices are protected. Next, when I'm on-the-go, I always have a power bank with me. And I want one that is high capacity, offers fast charging, can charge multiple devices at once, and doesn't take forever to recharge. So the Ugreen 145-Watt Power Bank has a 25,000 milliampere-hour capacity, which is a ton, has two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, and I can get up to 100 watt from a single port. Has a digital display so I know exactly how much power is remaining unlike power banks with four indicator lights. And the bidirectional charging means that I can actually charge two devices while I'm recharging the power bank itself. Now, with all these accessories, you're probably thinking how am I gonna bring all of them with me and keep them organized, so I'll tell you how. The tomtoc Padfolio is one of my absolute favorite iPad accessories ever. Essentially, it's a two-in-one protective case and tech bag, plus I love how it looks. Starting out with the iPad compartment, it's separated from the rest of the accessories with this rigid divider that has a velvety, soft fabric to it. So this way, even if you don't have a screen protector or a case, your iPad is completely protected. The compartment is also big enough to fit the iPad with the case that I showed you and even the Magic Keyboard. Next, when we flip the divider over, we see that on the back cover, there's a ton of elastic straps for different accessories. So whether you pick up the ones that I showed you, or even different ones, it's a really versatile option. Now finally, on the inside of the front panel, there's a large compartment that can house some of the larger accessories that I showed you, like the stand or the stand hub, and the hard shell exterior of the Padfolio adds even more protection from drops. It passed a military-grade drop test, and it's rated for a five-foot drop. So as long as you don't go and play soccer with it, you should be fine. And just in case you spill anything on it, the Padfolio is wrapped in a water-repellent fabric to protect your items, and it uses dual YKK zippers with really nice pulls. Alright, so now we get to the iPad accessory that I use every single day, and it's the X36 from Kuxiu. I really have no idea how to say it. I hope that's even remotely close. Anyways, the X36 is a super useful foldable magnetic stand, and we have ours in the gym. The iPad just snaps to it so there's no clamp to mess with. You can rotate it depending on which orientation you want, and you can tilt it up or down so it's always facing you. I also love the fact that I can easily adjust the height so I can have the iPad at eye level whether I'm standing, kneeling, or on the ground. Now, originally, I wasn't sure that I was even going to use this stand, but it's so good, and it's so versatile. I use it every day now and had to add it to this list.
