My_Everyday_Carry_Tech___EDC_2023____YouTube
 
[Music] foreign since I've shown you all what I take with me whenever I leave the house in terms of tech and so much has changed since then and this is actually a better time of year to make the video because in the later half of the year so much changes in terms of technology so I wanted to keep you all up to date with all the EDC I'm using at the moment and of course like usual I'm going to break this into the essentials list and the maybes list and I will try my best to link everything in the description below so let's get right into it okay first up let's talk about my phone and it probably won't come as a huge surprise but I'm using the iPhone 14 pro Max in the Deep Purple colorway generally speaking there's three reasons I use an iPhone and I've explained before so I don't want to jump into it too hard but one is I'm in the Apple ecosystem so it just makes sense for me to be on an iPhone two is it's got fantastic camera display and battery life which is something I really need as a Creator something which keeps on going all day and is fantastic with social media apps which is really important and thirdly and this is probably the most important of all those things is all of my friends and immediate family use an iPhone so I stay connected to them a lot easier with the iPhone 14 pro Max you're getting the cool updates like the dynamic Island and obviously the 48 megapixel camera which was the huge upgrade here and that was kind of one of the reasons which really made me kind of jump up from the 13 Pro is that the camera on here is absolutely fantastic and some of the photos and some of the video I've taken with this phone have just been incredible it kind of means I don't take out my dedicated camera as much as I used to because the pro raw mode on here is just so fantastic and you can edit the photos in Lightroom and get some really nice results every photo I upload to kind of Instagram or Twitter or wherever else has all been edited too and I've been using my own set of presets for this which I'm really happy to say I've just released in a brand new pack so if you do want to edit in a similar way to I do and you use Lightroom and you like that kind of grainy sort of pastel Vibe which I kind of push here on the channel massively then check it out it helps support the channel and I'll link it in the description below not to mention the battery life on the pro Max series is why I always stay with the bigger phone it just means I never ever ever have to worry about battery life on these devices and I get through a day absolutely no problems on here and I can even stretch it to two days if I need to as well one thing I will say though is upgrading your phone every year isn't particularly healthy Behavior but because I make content and because I post on social media and because of all those things kind of added up it just means having the newer device makes my business life a lot easier so that's generally speaking why I always stay up to date with it if I wasn't making content on YouTube I'd probably still be using my iPhone 10 or 11 and I'll be more than happy with that or maybe I'd even jump over to Android but for me and for now the iPhone 14 pro Max is my phone of choice next up is the phone case which I use on this which I don't use all the time but I use it occasionally and when I do use it I generally get so many questions about it but this is just a really simple apple official silicone case they're relatively expensive but it is in this wonderful colorway which is the succulent one and combined with the Deep Purple kind of iPhone underneath it it just looks gorgeous and this case has been really really nice generally speaking I'm not huge on cases I've used some Rhino Shield ones before which I've really liked but I saw this one in the Apple Store and I gave it a go and I was like do you know what this is actually really nice and one of my favorite things about it is when you snap the phone in it kind of makes the magsafe noise and it matches the color of the case you put it in which is kind of like weirdly satisfying but it just feels really good it's nice to hold in the hand feels nice and protective it's got a bit of a lip and yeah when I'm going out somewhere where I think my phone might be dropped or something like that then this is the case I drop it into and yeah I just really really like it moving on from there is something which I picked up recently and I really really love it but it probably should be in the movies because I don't use it every day but I wanted to talk about it and this is the anchor Mago wireless charger with magsafe and this thing is so cool and I kind of knew they're around for a while but I only picked up recently because I've been going on some longer Journeys I thought you know maybe I'll need this and it's cool this is just an external battery bank but it snaps to your iPhone and charges it wirelessly through magsafe which I really like and not to mention it also acts as a stand as well so you can have your iPhone standing up if you're trying to watch something or if you want it standing up next to your laptop or something like that and it would charge that up too and obviously I really love the color on this one it just matches everything else I've got going on including the new case I got for my iPhone and it's just absolutely brilliant it doesn't charge up a pro Max phone entirely but it gives you about 50 to 60 which is enough if you're kind of in a bit of a pinch what I also like about it too is it also doubles up as a wireless charger for kind of anything so you can throw your airpods on there if you need a bit of a charge or for friends this phone is running low you can just chuck her phone on it and it will charge up too I'm almost to annoyed at myself for not picking this up sooner because I absolutely love it but yeah that's the anchor mag Go Wireless power really really cool little device let's talk about watches now because I wanted to talk about this Apple Watch series 8 which is an upgrade for me I've been using this series 4 since 2018 and very recently I jumped up to the series a and what I wanted to say is I do regret it ever so slightly while I really like the Swatch and I think the screen update is just wonderful and the battery life and all those sorts of things are fantastic the OverWatch Ultra was just really nice and I saw that in the Apple Store and I had a quick go on it and I just think perhaps I should have just jumped to that because that was like a really serious upgrade I've got quite big wrists so it fit on me nicely but the other thing I do think as well is I jumped up to the series 8 and all the features that came with that I don't really use so I think I probably could have jumped to the series 7 and kind of got on every single new feature that I was looking for and saved a bit of money too but I did go for the series 8 and I have been really enjoying it it's actually the thing that started off this succulent kind of colorway thing for me because it came with that succulent band and I just really liked it one of the things that I really enjoyed the most on it though is the newer Apple watch faces the one where all the numbers are to the edge looks absolutely gorgeous and some of the ones which are a bit more complicated are actually really nice too and you can color customize those as well generally speaking though I've really enjoyed this update the battery life alone has kind of been worth it and the fact this can charge up quite a lot quicker than my old one as well it's just really nice to have it means I don't have to charge it overnight I can just put it on charge here and there whenever it needs it so yeah that's it for Watch series 8. I really like it but perhaps I should have gone with a series 7. on the weekends though I don't wear my Apple watch and I try my best to not think about content and things like that too much so I've started wearing mechanical watches instead and my main watch is a no Moss Club campus 38 which is this beautifully minimal hand winding incredible piece of German craftsmanship and I really really love that thing but recently and despite My Kind of Love of pastel and kind of simple things I picked up this completely blacked out Seiko 5 sports which I honestly absolutely love this is such a good looking watch and it kind of goes with absolutely any outfit I don't have to worry about it I've paired it with 11 NATO which just makes it feel a bit more premium because the strap you get with them isn't great and this is just such a fantastic look and because it's not too expensive I don't have to worry about scratching it or anything like that you also get so much for your money with Seiko you know get the seafood case back you get automatic movement and hand widening and all those sorts of things which are really really important and you get it all for like a really good price so if you're looking for an entry-level drug into kind of the watch World check out Seiko they're just awesome to wrap up some things which haven't changed either so I'll quickly go over these so using the orbit key organizer to keep all of my keys nice and together this just means they don't jangle around unless you have a car key attached to it which I do but generally speaking keeps everything nice and organized they'll flip out for easy use which I really really like I'm still using my Herschel Card Wallet which is a super minimal way just to hold cards cash is just kind of not really used that much in the UK anymore so I've kind of Switched everything over to my phone or to cards and lastly is the original airpods Pro I've tried out a bunch of different wireless headphones I tried out the nothing here once I tried out the edifier ones I've tried out some Sony ones but I always always end up coming back to the airpods pro they're just the best for noise cancellation they've got a really great sound and they pair with iPhone and mac and the iPad just so seamlessly it just makes so much sense for me to use these what I will say though is I've had this since 2019 and I think they're slowly on their way out the battery life lasts about a week now and I was getting like a full month of use out of them when I do put them into my ears they kind of fuzz a little bit but yeah airpods Pro absolutely fantastic especially if you're in the Apple ecosystem so that wraps up my everyday essentials but I did want to talk about the maybes too and these are things I take with me perhaps if I'm all working away from the office all day or if I just need to take a bag somewhere so we can carry things back or something like that so we might as well start with the bag which holds all of these maybes and this is the fjal Raven kanken laptop 17 just in the black colorway this is kind of my day pack of choice at the moment and I really really like it it's kind of got that iconic design it's not a perfect bag by any means I think the straps are a little bit wimpy if you're going anywhere kind of for a long time and the bottle pocket isn't great you have to buy an extra attachment for that which is just wild but otherwise I do really like the bag and it's perfect if I'm just nipping out for the day one of my own customizations I've done to that bag if you can call it a customization is to turn it into a small camera pack too I bought this camera insert from Earth and there's space in there for kind of three bodies or for two lenses and a body what I really like about it as well is it's pretty much the same width as the Cancun bag so it sits in there really kind of solidly and it feels like part of the bag which is something which I was going for one of the things it also carries as well which is something which is very much a maybe for me it depends on the day and all those sorts of things is it holds my Fujifilm xe4 now I don't take this with me everywhere I'd be totally lying if I said I do but I always keep it in there and recently I've been enjoying the moment Cindy Bloom filter on this which kind of gives all the photos out of this camera this kind of hazy look which is really nice works really well with lights it kind of makes them bloom out it just looks really beautiful what I like about the Fuji camera though is with the film simulations I don't have to edit anything on here I just take everything in JPEG and I post it immediately so if I'm going somewhere like big for the day like for London or to another city or something like that it's nice to have this on me this is such a little tiny camera and it just produces such amazing results it's also really useful if you want to pick up some kind of more detailed video the 4K out of this camera is absolutely wonderful and the Eternal film simulation from Fuji is just something I really love to work with lens wise I've been loving the 35 F2 I've also got the 15 to 45 kit which is really cheap but it's actually really good and I really like that lens too so yeah that's the future film setup which sits inside the little Earth bag which sits inside the kanken bag which I always take with me if I've got room you may remember from last time but one of the things on my movies was this custom Game Boy Pocket I had made for me and while I really like it I've actually stopped taking it around with me pretty much completely because the battery life on this is Dreadful I get about an hour out of it and not to mention on top of that my Pokemon Red game got deleted because the power went out while I was saving and since then I just tried to start Pokemon Silver but honestly the energy for me to do that has just gone so I might start looking into one of those small emulators instead but yeah I still really like this but I don't take it with me anymore from last time I saw I'm still using the Chili's coffee mug this is great if I'm going out to get a coffee if I remember to take it but the thing is this thing is actually so good that it holds the heat in almost too much so by the time I'm home from going to the coffee shop I have to take the lid off and drink it like that because it's still so hot but yeah this is really good they come in a bunch of colorways and I've always enjoyed Chili's stuff okay to round off the maybe's list and this is something I'll take with me if I feel like I'll need it it's either the iPad Air or my M1 Pro MacBook Pro this obviously depends on what I'm going to be doing during the day and most of the time I will take the iPad with me but if I know I'm going to be doing some video editing of any kind then I pretty much just take the MacBook with me this is a 14 inch base model M1 Pro MacBook Pro and though it's not too heavy to carry around with you it's absolutely fine and because it's 14 inch as well I can just slide it into my bag no problem but as you know I love the iPad and the iPad Air just has this great combination of features and for me if I'm taking my bag out it almost feels silly to not include it so I always bring it with me so that just about rounds up all of my everyday carry Tech which I'm taking with me at the moment and it'll be for the most part of this year too but as ever I'd like to hear from you so if you've got any things you think I should check out or if you've been using anything specifically that you think is cool let me know in the comments below and as ever I will see you all in the next one foreign [Music]
