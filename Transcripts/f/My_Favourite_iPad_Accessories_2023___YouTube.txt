My_Favourite_iPad_Accessories_2023___YouTube
 
[Music] foreign I can't believe I haven't made this video sooner than I have it's almost been two years since I showed you what my favorite iPad accessories are and obviously a huge amount has changed with iPad since then so I wanted to update you on what my favorite iPad accessories have been since then so let's get right into it okay first up is this iPad Dock from satachi and I'm so frustrated I didn't use this in my previous video where I did a big iPad external monitor review because this dock has absolutely everything you need in it to get your iPad into that more desktop-like experience not only does it hold the iPad really nicely but you're also getting an HDMI out so you can plug it into a monitor USB a USBC a headphone jack you're also getting a Micro SD cardstock and a standard SD card slot as well and that all plugs directly into the iPad from this cable on the bottom and it's really nice because this folds up as well so if you want to take it somewhere with you if you want to take it in your bag or something like that you can just fold it up and you're good to go and it's really nice and slim so yeah starting us off that's a really nice one there from satechi next up is another one from satechi or sateki or however you say their name is this little USBC Apple watch charging pack and this is kind of perfect for iPad because it's not only is it tiny but you can plug it into the side of the iPad directly and then you can pop your Apple watch onto it and get that Top-Up of charge whenever you need it and because it's magnetic you can actually charge your Apple watch while you're typing or doing something else completely different on the iPad as long as you don't lock it off you may have seen me use this in my iPad Air Day in the Life video when I forgot to charge my watch which is something I do quite often because I don't charge it overnight I always charge it throughout the day or something like that and it's just a little something I keep in my bag all the time that works really nicely with the iPad talking of baggable items and this is something that's worth getting if you're into iPad at all is to get a mini USBC adapter which has got all of the inputs you could possibly need on it this one I picked up from Amazon quite a long time ago and it snaps neatly to the iPad and it's kind of got everything you need HDMI usba it's got all your card readers and it's got a couple usbcs on the side as well as as a headphone jack I don't think they make this one anymore it's kind of one of those strange unbranded 30 pound sort of things but you can find them all over Amazon the only thing I will say is the quality of this isn't great the transfer speeds and things like that isn't fantastic but it's great to use in a pinch if you need it and again it's a sandwich I keep in my bag and is especially useful for the iPad okay next up is one you've seen on this channel a huge amount and I've talked about it a huge amount but I've got to mention it here because it genuinely is one of my favorite ways to use the iPad and one of my favorite accessories this is the mag float from charge M Pro and it really is one of the best ways to use an iPad at least for me at the moment it's magnetic so you can just snap the iPad directly onto it and I like to have it sitting next to my monitor which lets me use the iPad for universal control which means I can control it with the same mouse and keyboard I've talked about that a lot and I really really like it but it's also perfect if you just want to have your iPad next to your monitor so you can just check it for things like notes or if you want quick access to iPad apps these stands are really really great you can rotate your iPad if you want to not only that but I've been really lucky to check some out early this one I'm looking at now is the magflight pro which has got an adjustable height so you can move it up and down which is really nice and they've also sent out a vase amount adapter one too which is something I'm going to be checking out soon I really love these stands they kind of changed how I work with the iPad they've changed my desk setup they've changed the way I kind of do a lot of things now all for the better as well there's loads of other stands out there so definitely have a look on Amazon and see if you can find some because I think for me at least a stand and an iPad is just a match made in heaven and I really really like it I know a lot of you out there like to use screen protectors and you want to pick up the right one for your iPad so that's why I'm really happy to say today's sponsor comes in paper-like if you don't already know pay-per-like is a screen protector for your iPad that makes it feel like you're actually writing on paper the secret Source here is the nanodoc technology which is spread all over the surface this adds some grip and resistance to your pencil inputs removing that unnatural feeling of writing on glass and replacing it with that familiar papery feel paper like is also better than it's ever been before it's now on version 2.1 and made in collaboration with a Swiss based manufacturer they're using new material Composites which means a distribution of the nanoduts is much more accurate and the plastic used is way thinner than before as a result of all of this paperlight 2.1 is way more transparent than the previous models it's a notable Step Up in picture Clarity so your iPad screen remains much more visible and bright so you can carry on drawing sketching note-taking or whatever else you're doing on your iPad without being distracted so if you want to protect your iPad screen and get that nice papery feel that you're used to then I'll leave a link to the paper like 2.1 in the description below and of course a huge thank you goes out to them for sponsoring this video Even though I haven't made this video in a while there's one thing which stayed consistent and that's the apple pencil I really do think this is one of the best and most essential accessories for the iPad even if you're not into drawing and you just want to take notes or if you just want to interact with your iPad on a more kind of finer detail level these are great but I do know they're really expensive so what I did look into for this video was to check out the Logitech crayon and kind of like a third-party rip-off apple pencil this one's called the metapen this was 20 pounds respectively and this was 60 pounds respectively and for context of normal Apple pencils somewhere between 100 and 120 pounds depending which generation you're getting let's start with this meta pen it looks just like an apple pencil charges via USBC on the top and it turns on and off with a tap and it also snaps to the side of the iPad as well in a very similar fashion to the second generation apple pencil but it doesn't charge it just kind of sits there so they've obviously got some magnets in here which is nice this feels very similar indeed it feels cheap and plasticky though is what I will say but the actual writing experience and usage experience is surprisingly decent you don't get any of the pressure sensitivity because that's an apple pencil only thing but you do get kind of curvature so if you can write normally like that and then you can actually put it on its side and kind of get those bigger swoops of a pencil or a brush not bad at all and for 20 pounds I don't think you can go too wrong so if you're not too sure about getting an apple pencil then something like this like a meta pen not too bad at all the Logitech Crown was actually really decent as well it was a bit more expensive at 60 pounds the design is definitely different here it takes a while to kind of get used to this kind of oblong sort of shape but once you do it's really nice and I enjoyed using it a lot I preferred this over the meta pen because it was just a bit easier to find and it felt a lot more sturdy to use but both of them are decent this one doesn't snap to the iPad sadly so you have to keep track of it and both of these pens you have to turn on and off which is kind of a weird experience and very easy to forget to do and you've got to charge them both of these don't pair to the iPad either that you can just use them straight away but in terms of usage the Logitech crayon was very very good and in a way very similar to the mess pen you've got standard writing experiences no pressure sensitivity but if you write normally you get a nice standard look and you can obviously tilt the pen as well and get more of those longer brush Strokes if you're an artist or something like that so to sum these two pencils up really quickly for you you can actually get an apple pencil experience for a really really good value now this 20 pounds one was pretty decent and the Logitech crayon was a lot more decent it felt a lot more sturdy and you know they're both coming in well under what Apple are asking for so if you're not too sure these are definitely worth a go-to if you want a full video on apple pencil Alternatives let me know in the comments below and I'll definitely look into it okay next up is one which took me a really long time to come around to but now I have I can't really imagine my iPad use without it and that is the Apple magic keyboard and and now I know these are really really expensive especially if you need one for the 12.9 inch iPad but they are really really decent and it's kind of fundamentally changed how I use the iPad a couple years ago I was still happy to just use the iPad as a kind of a tablet first experience but since these keyboards came out and since Apple made all the improvements with Stage manager and things like that a keyboard now more than ever feels like one of the essential accessories and the magic keyboard case from Apple is potentially the best way to go the reason I like the Apple magic keyboard is because you don't need an extra kind of thing to make the iPad clip into it you just take the iPad on and off and it snaps in magnetically and you're good to go there's no kind of case which it needs hanging around or any magnets you need to put on the back and not to mention the general typing and keyboard experience on the magic keyboard is really really good and you get a nice keyboard backlight as well like I said these are really expensive so it's definitely worth looking at what Logitech have to offer because they've got some really nice Alternatives but there's also a huge amount of Bluetooth keyboards out there which will work fine they just take a little bit more of a setup getting a keyboard really changes up how you feel and use the iPad and it's really an essential accessory as well okay this next one is for people who like to game on their iPads and this is a recent pickup for me this is the 8-Bit do ultimate wireless controller I've been using an sn30 Pro from 8-bit do for a while but I just found it really uncomfortable but this ultimate controller is Kind of Perfect in so many ways it's similar to an Xbox one which is what I'm most used to in terms of its thumbstick layout but you get absolutely everything you need here it's a rechargeable battery you've got back paddles to customize if you want to and all the buttons and everything like that feel great on it not only does it work on iPad but it also works on Windows and Mac and switch too so it's kind of become my go-to controller for everything I do in the office it also comes with a little dock as well which recharges it which is really nice but for any iPad gaming I do and for any switch gaming I do now actually this has been my go-to and I really really like it lastly one thing before you go I always like to throw in a bonus thing and this time around this isn't a specific accessory for the iPad but it's something you can use and something you can listen to while you are using the iPad and that's my new Lo-Fi Channel this is kind of the official second channel of byte review so if you enjoy Lo-Fi music to kind of help you get into work then we've made a bunch of it and it's sitting over on another Channel we just released a second drop of it which is actually playing here at the moment which you can see and it's all hand written there's no AI there's no kind of shortcuts or anything like that it's something that we've worked really really hard on and we really hope you enjoy it to help you get some work done or to just focus or to just chill out and relax with so I'll link that below as well check it out it's called Career crew radio so that just about rounds up all of the iPad accessories I've been really enjoying over the past couple of years but of course I'm always open to suggestions so let me know in the comments below if you think there's any others I should check out that would be great and I will see you all in the next one foreign
