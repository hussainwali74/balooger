M2_Pro_MacBook_Pro_14___My_Experience___YouTube
 
foreign [Music] my favorite Apple product it'd be really easy to kind of point at the iPhone or if you've watched this channel for a while to point at the iPad and to be like yep that's the one but for the last four or five months since I picked up the new M1 Pro MacBook Pro I've slowly come to realize that overall those laptops are some of the best I've ever used and I've been trying out this M2 Pro MacBook Pro for just over a week now and that's really cemented my feelings these laptops are really incredible and they kind of blown me away in so many different areas and in this video I wanted to explain why so let's get right into it oh and while I am looking at the M2 pro model here pretty much everything I say applies to last year's M1 pro model as well I did want to start this video with some harsh truths so let's dive into those really quickly if you've got an M1 Pro or an M1 Max MacBook Pro from last year then there really is no reason to upgrade here while there's some incremental upgrades for the processor and things like that in day-to-day use it's very difficult to notice the difference and honestly I don't think Apple were trying to convince you to upgrade if you already have those models the massive jump was from Intel to the M1 stuff these just mean if you're looking at a brand new Macbook and you're stood on the Intel stuff then you're just going to get the very best of what Apple has to offer at the moment and I think that's a really good thing on the outside there's no new design either so there's no reason to look at it for that and of course if you're looking to do any gaming on a laptop then please just look elsewhere while Macs are slowly getting better and there's some really cool stuff with metal these aren't made for gaming and if you're expecting that then you should really look at a Windows laptop or just get something else completely for some context for this review my MacBook Pro is a base M1 Pro so that's the eight CPU cores and 14 GPU cores 16 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gig of storage and the one I'm testing here from the M2 is the M2 Pro with 12 CPU cores 19 GPU cores 16 gig of RAM and one terabyte of storage so that's kind of where you can see I'm coming from house troops aside let's look at what actually is new on this M2 pro version you're getting a better HDMI slot so you're getting 2.1 now which means you can support up to 8K monitors which is obviously insane there's been a bump to Wi-Fi which is nice and Bluetooth has had a bump as well which just means you're more future proofed in general which is always good but of course the big upgrade here is the M2 Chip which supports up to 12 CPU cores and 19 GPU cores and it's around 20 to 30 percent faster than the M1 Pro in kind of most areas which is always a nice bump to have but I think the biggest thing here for most of us and especially for me and my testing is there's now 4 efficiency course which means the battery life on this M2 Pro unit is even better than the M1 Pro which was already insane so I think that's where people are going to see those bigger upgrades or the more usable ones anyway because in my usage comparing the M1 to the M2 Pro the difference is kind of hard to spot and even though it is a little bit faster here and there it's not a huge difference but we'll talk about that a bit more later the reason these are my favorite Apple products in years though is because these MacBooks have now kind of three fundamentals one is power two is battery life and three is the screen and all of those for a laptop especially one that's creatively driven are absolutely essential and again this goes for the M2 Pro and the M1 pro versions and in terms of power we could talk about benchmarks and things like that for days on end and I completely agree benchmarks have their place but for me I much rather know what they're like I'm on a general use to use basis and for all of these laptops and especially for this M2 Pro the performance is absolutely rapid you know opening things closing things and switching between apps and having loads of apps open feels more like an iPhone experience or an iPad experience than a laptop everything's just razor quick and rapid and another beach ball or feel like I'm waiting for anything to happen on these laptops they really are kind of next-gen feeling and I really like that about them and one of the things that's really made the power stand out to me is I can press export on a video in Final Cut Pro and then jump over to photoshop and continue working on my thumbnail or go back into Google Chrome and continue watching a YouTube video or something like that all while that video is exporting which is a really kind of laborious task and when I used to do that on my custom PC which is just sitting behind me there whenever I hit export on a video the fans would start spooling up and that computer would take off and it would kind of render the rest of the PC absolutely useless but on these MacBook Pros I can actually just get on with my normal work and it's not a problem and while I'm doing that the fan doesn't even spool up it just carries on like normal and it doesn't even get too warm on my lap the footage I'm working with in Final Cut as well is tough as well this is heavily compressed 4K it's h.265 and it's really squished down and usually that would bring my custom PC and my old Intel MacBook to its knees because it's so hard to work with but this M2 Pro and you know the M1 Pro before it just absolutely tear through it with their media engines it's also shown me that 16 gigabytes is you know enough I always thought I needed to push up to 32 gigabytes of RAM to have a normal experience which is what I've got in my Mac Studio but these MacBook Pros just handle it really well I've never encountered any Ram based issues at all so basically from a power level you can get this entry level M2 or M1 pro version and be totally fine if your workflow is similar to what I do which is photo editing video editing design work Photoshop work you know anything in figma or any of the Adobe Creative Suite apps this thing absolutely kills it even on that base level and that's really really liberating to have secondly is battery life 2. now on this M2 Pro I've noticed that the battery life difference is even greater than it was on the M1 Pro I'm getting about two to three days on the charge here if I'm not doing anything too intensive and then if I am doing something like editing in Final Cut or you know playing around in a Lightroom all day it's all day no problem and then perhaps some the next day either and that's just really useful it means if I'm going to a coffee shop to work or if I'm going to a friend's house to work or somewhere else you know and I've got like 30 of battery left I don't even worry about it I don't even put a charger in my bag because I can just go and now I'm gonna have loads of battery life from that 30 and that's been a real game changer and lastly is the screen these screens on these laptops are just incredible 120 hertz is mini LED not OLED which you could class as a shame but honestly they're so so good it's better than my main screen which I use at my desktop they're better than the Mac Studio screen they're super bright I'm never having to worry about being able to see anything they're really color accurate as well which means I can edit video on there and not have to worry about what it's going to look like on all these other devices and the 120 hertz refresh rate just makes everything feel really smooth and kind of responsive and it's just a really great experience oh and if you like the wallpapers in this video they're from my Toyo pack which I'll link in the description below so it's a combination of those three things of what kind of makes this my perfect Apple product the fact I can run my entire creative life of this M2 Pro MacBook Pro and honestly that goes for the M1 Pro MacBook Pro as well is incredible I can do all of my video editing all of my photo editing all of my Adobe Creative Suite apps like InDesign and Photoshop and Lightroom and then using things like figma or anything else like that can all be done on this laptop is incredible there's no need to kind of bump up the power or bump up the Ram or bump up anything else even in the base M1 pro package so jumping up to M2 Pro is just going to give you all of that again and then some it's going to last for longer too so that's what makes it kind of my favorite Apple product at the moment okay so I've got something embarrassing I need to admit especially for this review I've just been at my local coffee shop working on the new M2 Pro for about an hour or so working on some photoshop stuff and editing lots of this video and I was you know testing the performance making sure the battery life and all that stuff is up part and it is and that's even posting about it on Instagram saying you know any questions for the review or anything like that and then it's not until I get home I realize I've actually taken my old M1 Pro over the M2 Pro because I often leave this in my bag and this has been on my desk for testing a lot and look they're exactly the same size same colorway the 14 inch silver they use the same desktop wallpaper I transferred over absolutely everything so I could test it out properly so you know the mistake was completely on me but it does go to show how good the M1 Pro still holds up against the M2 the fact that I didn't even realize until you know I saw it when I got home and felt like a total idiot but there you go I just thought that was at least worth throwing in here so to round up my thoughts on the M1 Pro and to give you some advice as well is if you want the latest and greatest from Apple then any of the M2 variants is going to get you an absolutely incredible computer that will last you for years and years and years however what I will say is don't shy away from the M1 stuff still if you can get some discount or if you can get it from Apple's refurbished website for a bit cheaper this is kind of like 90 of the laptop vm2 is and I'm going to stick with my M1 Pro base model because I don't feel like there's anything there to kind of really drag me up to M2 so that's kind of how I'd leave it but of course I'd love to hear your thoughts if you're just grabbed an M2 or if you're still using the M1 Pro let me know in the comments below how is it going for you and all those sorts of things and as ever I will see you all in the next one foreign [Music]
