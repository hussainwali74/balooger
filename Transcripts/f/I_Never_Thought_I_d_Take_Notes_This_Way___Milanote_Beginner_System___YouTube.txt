when you think of digital notes you probably think notes folders Pages links in other words you think of text but there's been a quiet Revolution going on in note taking see digital notes have a flaw when they're out of sight they're also out of mind unlike physical spaces most digital notes don't have any kind of spatial memory a digital note isn't placed over here or living over there or behind that a digital note is just in the app somewhere I've been living in Evernote for the last seven years but lately I've been exploring New note-taking Frontiers and today I'm checking out millinotes I'm going to design a building a second brand style millinote workspace step by step from scratch then I'm going to share my top three visual note-taking practices I can see myself using in my own second brain in the future [Music] so how does millinote work once you sign up you'll immediately notice that you're in a massive open canvas view with nothing to See For Miles Don't Panic just click on the upper left or double click anywhere to start making notes a note in millinote looks like a floating box you can move around and add text to you can format that text in a variety of ways add a color or colored bars or pick a different kind of note from the sidebar such as an images note or a bunch of different types of media but the main way of organizing millinote is something called boards when we think of notes apps like Evernote or obsidian we think of folders which are pretty much just containers to put similar notes in to help you find them again and if you want you can put irrelevant folders inside those folders the information lives in the notes you create and the folders exist to store and organize the notes but you also have apps like notion that combine the idea of a note and a folder into something called a page a page has information it's a traditional note but it can also store other Pages by creating a new page inside that page Miller note boards are kind of like pages in notion when you create notes on a board it stores that information so the board itself is one big note but you can create new boards inside those boards like a folder but there's one key difference from other apps you've got a crazy amount of Freedom instead of a single vertical space outline or fixed columns your information can live anywhere on the board or even be stacked up on top of itself so let's create our first board by dragging it out of the toolbar on the left obviously I'm Thiago Forte so my first board will be called projects and next we'll do areas resources and archives as you can see the boards are Auto assigned a color and an icon to match the board based on its name but let's go over to our left toolbar and recolor these so they look extra appealing nice I like this much better and then just for fun we'll left click drag to select all four of these icons now right click and select connect with lines and now if we move these boards around they'll still stay connected so we have four boards that are ready to put content inside of them a project board for the things I'm actively working on that have a clear end goal an areas board for the important stuff in my life I need to keep track of and maintain a resources board for anything that might be useful in the future and an archives board for things I don't expect to look at again but want to keep around just in case now these look just like folders right now but since this is a visual space I could add all kinds of stuff here like a note about what each of these mean or images that get me excited to open these up but for now I think what I'll do is just use the draw feature on the left to remind myself of my prioritization here for projects I'm going to check these weekly these are important to keep top of mind and refresh regularly my areas I'll review monthly or whenever it feels important resources I'll only review as needed and archives are storage okay I think we're ready for the next layer let's double click on the projects board now we're inside a new board if I want to get to the previous one by the way I can hit command and left bracket or forward bracket to jump back and forth or look at the top of my screen to see more information about where the board I'm looking at lives so one way to add a little more structure to a board is creating columns wherever you like on your board let's click on columns in the left toolbar and drag one out into our space we can click into the column to add a title I'm calling this one active projects if you're familiar with para projects are anything you're working toward with a clear goal and a time to complete a buy so let's make this extra clear and create a big visual reminder a new note up here and we can color it so it stands out a bit and then if we click on the note and hover on the right corner we can click this Arrow to create a connector line between these notes you can change the ends of the connector to Be an Arrow or a dotted line but I think I'm going to leave it as a normal line right now this column is a bit empty so let's add a project here we'll create another board and drag it into the column so that it clicks into place right here one of my projects right now is tracking our YouTube video performance so let's call this UTM tracking parentheses YouTube conversions once we click into this project board we can start adding content so I've added a column here because really the UTM project is being spearheaded by our video producer Geo so I added his proposal and some of the details here as well as a cool image of him as part of his proposal Geo shared this article so I'll go ahead and add that onto the board by the way whenever you copy and paste a link it's stored in this unsorted area on the right side which you can close or open this is a good way to just hold on to notes that you aren't sure where you want to place yet once it's here I can drag it out into the board and then connect it to the initial proposal you'll see that it automatically pulls in the thumbnail and summary too okay course in the process of reading through the article I used highlighting to note the most important points I'm going to do a form of progressive summarization and grab the most important highlights and put them on my board either as text so I can edit it or just screenshots of the page that I copy and paste into the board to do this extra fast and I noticed there's a UTM Builder Link in that article so I'll pull that out here as well since that's an important resource if we move forward additionally let's add a few action items I'll go to the toolbar and drag out this item which creates a to-do note now I've added a few action items from Geo and from the article I just read I can leave comments and tag others to help if they have access to my board or I can even just share a public version of this and enable commenting I can just lay out the information in an intuitive way and even leave little notes or guidelines for myself or a future collaborator let's go back to our projects board and add some more content as we start to add projects we might start to get a little too ambitious or not ambitious enough so let's add another note to remind me of my philosophy of projects thiago's rule aim for 10 to 15 active projects these are projects I'm committed to completing in the near term this is a good reminder as I'll actually be able to see visually the amount of projects I have here as I add them and there's this nice little reminder up here of the number of boards I have in this column so it's even faster to evaluate how many projects I have in motion I'm going to go ahead and create the rest of my kanban as well as a few more projects you'll see there's a sequence here from future projects to upcoming projects active projects then completed and archived projects to keep these categories clear I've added little descriptions of their purpose as notes that I drag into the columns then whenever a project is ready to start I can pull it from the upcoming projects or when a project is complete I can move it to completed projects here's one I'm working on with my team a potential reshoot of one of our courses if you look at this we have a high level visualization of our annual calendar and where this project could fit in I've dropped in images of a blank calendar and then used the draw tool to outline key dates and timings I could easily add more details for each calendar event here or whatever else is relevant for the project as it develops let's go back to our home page now and click into our areas here's how I've set up my areas you'll notice it's similar to the projects but it's a lot more free form instead of a clear sequence that projects move through areas are grouped more by interest and type and they're meant to inspire me or remind me of my priorities not keep me laser focused on what I have to do immediately it's more about habits and daily practices a kind of mindfulness if I click into an area there might be structure and specific items or things to manage or it might just be visual inspiration or even a workflow of how to think about a particular aspect of my life it's about the intersection of creativity and productivity where those two meet and complement one another by the way you can put one board in multiple places all you have to do is right click it and select create a shortcut for this board this will allow you to put a relevant project in both your active projects board and then also have it accessible under an area this helps out when you think something should be in multiple spots at once after using millinodes here are the three features I find most interesting about its visual note-taking philosophy first I love the combination of a free form structure on a page level while structure enabled on a folder level in apps like logseek and obsidian sometimes there's not enough structure it's free form but it takes work to organize things whereas in apps like notion or Evernote there's so much structure that you have to do significant pre-planning millinote is a great balance of the Best of Both Worlds second ease of sharing with external collaborators it's very easy to add collaborators or share a public version of the boards you're working on it's instantaneous has a notification system and feels great a third in general visual formatting makes note-taking much more accessible to others in the first place visual organization makes things so much more digestible and more inspirational for you or for others and it's clear that features are only added to Milano when they work and are built into the product at a deep level never just hacked on to increase the feature set so if you'd like to check out Milano go ahead and click the link in the description and get started organizing your visual notes today
