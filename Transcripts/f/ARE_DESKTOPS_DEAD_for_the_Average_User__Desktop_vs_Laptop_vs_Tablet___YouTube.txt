ARE_DESKTOPS_DEAD_for_the_Average_User__Desktop_vs_Laptop_vs_Tablet___YouTube
 
- The other day I was thinking about whether desktops are dead. With mobile devices becoming so powerful and capable, have we reached the point where most people shouldn't buy a desktop anymore? And at the same time, are tablet's powerful enough to where a laptop essentially become obsolete for the average user? Let's talk about it. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. The one tip I give everyone in any product category is that before you start watching reviews and comparing specs, the most important thing to think about is what you'll be using the device more. That more than anything else should drive your final decision. So let's start out by talking about processing power. Now, I know the companies are flaunting the latest and greatest CPUs and GPUs, and regardless of whether we're talking about desktops, laptops, or tablets, these components are becoming more and more powerful. But the real question you have to ask yourself is, do you actually need all that power? Are you getting enough value out of buying the absolute best while paying a premium? Now, for some users, the answer is yes, but for others it's not so clear. So I typically look at it this way. If a piece of gear can either save me time on something that I repeatedly do, or it removes friction from my daily workflow, then it becomes extremely valuable to me. Now, here's a simple example from my workflow, and you can expand from that to yours. I can edit a video on a tablet, a laptop, or a desktop, and within reason, they're all technically able to accomplish the same task. Now, a lot of times you'll hear marketing jargon like, "This processor can render a video 20 or 30% faster than the previous one." And while that's nice, it's not really a meaningful advantage to me. If I publish two to three videos a week, and the typical render time is between 10 to 15 minutes, we're looking at a saving of less than 15 minutes a week. But the more important advantage to me is the impact on the actual editing process. Can I smoothly scrub through the timeline? Does the video start playing immediately when I hit space bar? Can I preview motion graphics? Those are the types of things that I do hundreds of times during the six to eight hours it takes me to edit. And if that process is slowed down by insufficient processing power, then I need to use something else. Now in general, we're going to rank tablets at the bottom, laptops in the middle, and then desktops at the top when it comes to CPU and GPU performance. Now, this isn't to say that a tablet can't be more powerful than a laptop or a laptop can't be more powerful than a desktop, but if we're comparing devices in equal tiers, this is still the order. It's just a matter of form, factor and physics. As the devices get larger, you can use bigger components. There's more room for them, for example, for sticks of RAM or for a hard drive, and you have better passive and active cooling. Now, another important consideration is portability. Do you need to take your device with you? And when you do, what will you be using it for? There are some pretty small desktops these days, but for all intents and purposes, I'm still not packing one of these and taking it with me on the road. Tablets are smaller and lighter than laptops, so they make for excellent travel devices and for a lot of users, they can actually act as a laptop replacement with the addition of a keyboard case. Now, laptops are great because they can be plugged into very capable workstations and then essentially used as a desktop, and it can be taken with you when you need a smaller form factor. But what if you don't want to choose? What if you want one device that gives you the benefits of a desktop, a laptop, and a tablet? That brings me to today's sponsor, Best Buy and the HP Spectre Foldable PC. Now, this device is like nothing I've ever seen before. It has a foldable 17-inch bright and vivid 2.5K OLED display, which means that you can use it as a large tablet with the included wireless rechargeable pen. If you want more of a laptop-like experience, you can just fold the display and place the detachable magnetic Bluetooth keyboard on the lower part of the screen or slide a portion of it off and then use it in the extended laptop mode. And if you need a larger screen size, like a desktop, go ahead and unfold the device, put it in a landscape mode with the integrated kickstand, then use the full-size keyboard and track pad. And the best part is that when you're ready to go, the HP Spectre Fold easily folds into an extremely portable form factor, which you can take with you anywhere. So get your hands on HP's first ever three-in-one foldable PC at select Best Buy stores, or at bestbuy.com. And thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now, another interesting element to consider when choosing a device is the operating system. So tablet manufacturers continue to add features that make them behave more like typical desktop operating systems. For example, Apple has Stage Manager and Samsung has the extremely capable DeX. But keep in mind that these are essentially changes to the UI or the user interface, but you're not really able to use desktop apps. You're still using the mobile versions of each app. True desktop operating systems also offer better file management, because it's more of an essential component than it is with a mobile OS. Which brings me to something that a lot of people overlook, ergonomics, and let's start off by talking about typing. So most tablets have compatible keyboard cases. Laptops, of course, come with a keyboard, and then naturally, you'll have a dedicated keyboard for your desktop. But not all keyboards are created equal, and the best laptop keyboards are going to be better than the ones you get for your tablet. And your desktop keyboard will be even better than that. And it will offer a ton of options in terms of the types of switches and different keyboard layouts. Now, I wanna go back to something that I said in the beginning. Think about how you plan on using your device. Like, how much are you actually going to type on it? If you're just replying to a few emails, then pretty much any keyboard will do. But if you're typing for hours every day, then I would go with either a laptop with a really nice keyboard or a desktop. Now, if you're choosing a laptop, then you're stuck with whatever keyboard you get. So test it before you buy, and I really mean test it. Don't just type on it for a few seconds. Like, literally take a few minutes, sit there and type. And then think about things, like, is the layout big enough for you? Does the keyboard feel stable? Are the keys responsive? If you end up having to use an external keyboard every time, then you're losing the portability and convenience of a laptop. Another factor that we wanna look at, is the available ports on our device. Like, how many accessories do you wanna attach? Are you thinking of using a wired mouse and an external keyboard? Are you using portable SSDs? Do you want a single or multiple external displays? Will you need to bring a hub with you everywhere that you go? Again, the more you need, the more flexibility laptops will offer over tablets. Then of course, desktops are at the top. Desktops also give you the most versatility when it comes to components and upgrading. When you buy a tablet, you're making a fairly final commitment. You can't upgrade any of the internal components or the storage. So make sure that it will fit your needs for as long as you plan on using it. Now, some tablets do come with a micro-SD card slot, which allows you to expand the internal storage down the road. So that's something that you may want to consider when you purchase. On a laptop, it's a bit of a mixed bag. Some laptops give you the ability to upgrade certain components and others do not. But in any case, you're locked into the display type and size, the keyboard, the ports, and the form factor. Now, when we look at desktops, most, but not all, give you the flexibility to upgrade essentially every component, which means that you can get enough for what you need now and then add more when and if you choose to. It also means that if you want something like a bigger display than the one that you originally got, all you need to do is to upgrade that one component. And that brings me to budget. Now, assuming two components have similar performance, the smaller you have to make the component, the more expensive it's going to be. Meaning that to get a similar performance out of a laptop, you'll need to spend more money than you would on a desktop. So have we reached a point where most users don't need a desktop? The answer might be yes for a lot of users, but definitely not for everyone. For example, mobile gaming is great. I play "PUBG" all the time, and at the same time, it's just not the same as PC gaming. There are some excellent gaming laptops out there, but you'll be paying a premium for components. You'll most likely get the best performance when you're not on battery power. And if you're looking for portability, then you're limited to the keyboard and the display that you have. Now, the newest laptops are very capable of photo and video editing, and some are even capable of a 3-D workflow. But personally, I would still choose a desktop because of the improved ergonomics, the choice of accessories, and the performance to cost ratio. I'm also curious to know of these three different types of devices, what's gonna be your next purchase, and what will you use it for? Now, you should check out this comparison. You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy twice. Good luck and see you soon.
