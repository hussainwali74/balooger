[Music] one of the main reasons people seek out my work is because they're not making progress on their goals they have big ambitions there's things they want to build and achieve and experience in this life and those things seem to not happen week after week month after month year after year time seems to slip through their fingers like sand so they start getting curious about goals and look goals are important they describe a destination where you want to end up if you don't know your destination there's not much chance that you're ever going to get there but there are so many misconceptions about goals what they are what they're for how they're helpful and where they fall short one of the most common misconceptions is that setting a goal by itself makes a difference i'm here to tell you it doesn't goals are not magic spells what really makes a difference is what comes after setting that goal the project that you create to take you there projects are where things actually happen where intention meets action where the abstract plans in our head get manifested into this material reality if the goal is the destination a project is the vehicle that takes you there now i'm going to be very straight with you if you have a goal that you want to achieve but there's no project attached to it that is called a dream a lot of people think they have a writing goal when in fact they have a writing dream they think they have an exercise goal when in fact it's an exercise dream when i was in my early 20s i had a dream of living in a different country i talked about it i daydreamed about it i made lists of the amazing places that i would live but there was one distinct moment late at night when something flipped in my mind and that dream turned into a project i decided at that moment that i was going to apply to the peace corps which is an overseas volunteer program for americans who serve in other countries it was a challenging project just applying there were health checks background checks multiple rounds of applications and countless forms to fill out took over a year just to finish the application process that ended up being one of the most pivotal meaningful years of my entire life every dream is waiting for that one moment when you decide to commit and begin taking those practical steps only then does it become a goal now let's take the opposite case you have a project but no associated goal that is what's called a hobby in that case you're doing something you might even be doing a lot of it but if there's nowhere that you're trying to arrive at nowhere in particular then you must be basically doing it just for fun right you're saying you want to improve your budgeting let's say but you're not measuring your progress toward any kind of end result without a goal to give your efforts direction you're just as likely to take two steps forward but then take three steps back there is absolutely nothing wrong with hobbies okay hobbies give life texture they give life meaning you don't have to excel at everything you do not everything in life has to become a side hustle when you distinguish between projects and hobbies both of them get better you can work hard when it's time to work hard and fully relax when it's time to relax without confusing the two i'll summarize everything that i've said with one simple phrase a project without a goal is a hobby a goal without a project is a dream so i'm going to ask the same question of you what in your life that you say is a goal is really a dream what in your life that you say is a project is really a hobby when the moment arrives that you decide it's time to make real progress on something instead of just dreaming and instead of just tinkering you'll need two things you'll need a goal to inspire you and give you direction and you'll need a project to make it happen the most important turning point in my own life when it comes to consistently moving my most important projects to completion was creating what i call a second brain a personal system of knowledge management i've dedicated my career to teaching people how to create such a system for themselves through books and courses and content you can find out more at buildingasecondbrain.com thank you for watching i hope something that i've said today resonated with you i wish you the best luck in your projects and your goals and your dreams and your hobbies and i encourage you to join us if you're interested in building a second brain for yourself [Music] you
