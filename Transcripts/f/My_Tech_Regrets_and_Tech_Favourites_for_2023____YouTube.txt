My_Tech_Regrets_and_Tech_Favourites_for_2023____YouTube
 
[Music] I used a lot of tech in 2023 and some of it has been awesome and some of it has been really bad and some of it has kind of floated around in the middle and I wanted to run through all of that with you today and just so you know not all of this came out in 2023 but it was new to me or new to the channel in some way this year so let's get into it I actually wanted to start this video with the bad stuff because I didn't want to end this video on kind of a somber note and I'm going to start with two kind of controversial ones as well because I know these are very well liked products in the tech space and the first one is the Sony XM 4S and I know these are like hugely loved but for me I just cannot get on with them now to be clear I think the design is awesome they fold which is great and the active noise cancelling is second to none it's literally incredible when you put these on but for some reason I cannot get these to sound good whenever I use them I always disappointed by how boomy and horrible the base sounds and this is an awful thing to say but my old senis and momentums which look kind of silly and are wired and all that sort of stuff they sound so much better they're more Punchy and tight whereas these just feel really loose and I've tried absolutely everything to get these sound good I've used the Sony EQ app I've used the Spotify EQ I've tried switching to Apple music I've tried using the wire and everything but for some reason I just cannot get them to sound great and obviously sound is subjective so you could love it and that's fine I'm not having a go at anybody that likes these but it's gotten so bad to the point where I'm thinking about returning them because I just don't think they're doing it for me at all so yeah that's number one on list really disappointed by the Sony XM 4S number two on that list and it's another controversial one is this peak design everyday backpack and again another well-loved product but for me I think I fundamentally can't get on with it and the reason for that is because of the way that the dividers work on the inside now on paper I love this you can kind of fold these up and make the bag however you want but when you fill this bag with camera equipment which is something I do relatively often nothing feels secure for me so I've got expensive camera lens lenses and bodies in there and they're all kind of jiggling around while you're walking it doesn't feel safe and it doesn't like kind of fill me with any confidence at all which is a real shame because this bag otherwise is so nice it's beautifully made the pockets and the straps and all the extra bits you get with it are so well fought out and it's so nicely designed I like how it looks too but I cannot get on with this bag and I'm still using it at the moment but every day I use it for camera gear it kind of reminds me of why I don't like it so yeah another of one which is a complete shame those are the only two bad things but there was one thing which kind of floated around in the middle for me this year and that was the Apple Studio display and if you've been watching this channel for a while you know I had this before and ended up returning it but when I moved into the studio I really needed a new display for my Mac and the studio display was like kind of the only one which really stuck out for me because I was only plugging my Mac into it and the reason I'm putting it in the me area is because while I love it I think the speakers are great it's got a built-in webcam which is useful and it looks gorgeous and the 5K monitor itself is wonderful to use when I was working at home my monitor had my switch plugged into it my custom PC and my MacBook plugged into it which I found really useful but the studio display only has one input and it's USBC which means you can only pretty much plug one thing into it at a time and that pretty much has to be a Mac for you to get the best out of it now that's exactly what I wanted but for a monitor that costs over Â£1,000 I just think that's such a shame even if it had two USBC inputs so you could switch between Macs really quickly would be really use ful but having no HDMI or no display port or anything like that not even a headphone out just feels so weird so yeah I do love this display but it's so expensive and it's so hard to recommend to others unless you just need it for your Mac or MacBook okay moving on to the exciting stuff now cuz this was the best tech that I used all year and the stuff I really really liked and first up was my iPad vase amount which I got from charen Pro now this is something I had at my home office setup and it basically allowed me to have my iPad floating next to my monitor and it was just such a clean and lovely looking setup I had it on one of their previous stands before which I really liked but having it in this floating effect was just really really wonderful and it was the perfect way to use my iPad with my desktop setup and have that full continuity between both it only really works well if you've got it on that same monitor arm to give it that kind of floating look but for me this was a wonderful setup this year and I haven't managed to figure it out here at the studio yet but I am working on it secondly is this little USBC capture device now this one specifically hasn't been my favorite but what it's allowed me to do has made it absolutely one of my favorite pieces of tech I picked up this year this basically plugs into your iPad and it allows you to use it as an HDMI monitor for pretty much anything and I mainly used it for a bit of gaming I made a whole video on it which I'll link up here if you want to see it but this was probably the most fun video I made all year and it is all thanks to this little 30b dongle if you want to do something similar you can pick this up or you can pick up a better one which will give you much better results because this has a small amount of input lag when you connect it to the iPad and a little bit of screen tearing as well but it does deliver a pretty decent experience and I really enjoyed playing my switch and my PS5 on my iPad during that video it was really fun and if you buy a better version of it like the Elgato HDX 60 or something you can get way better results but yeah if you just want to use your iPad as an external monitor one of these little capture cards of a USBC on the side will do the job next up is something I've really loved this year and that is the Nintendo switch OLED model now I've had the original model for quite a long time but when tears of the Kingdom came out the new Zelda game I thought now is the time to go for the OLED version because I knew I'd be playing a lot of it handheld and it was honestly just purely wonderful to play it this way that OLED screen is so much nicer on this version and if you play a lot handheld the upgrade is completely worth it colors just pop off this thing and it looks so stunning I've also been playing the new Mario game Mario Wonder and that looks awesome on here as well I had a really good time with the switch OLED I ended up playing Zelda for over a 100 hours on it handheld and for the travel I did do which was mainly train based this was a wonderful companion to have and because I ended up enjoying the switch OLED so much I actually pulled the trigger recently and picked up the steam deck OLED and I haven't used this enough yet to kind of really talk about it but the games that I've tried on it have been really impressive and I'm kind of excited to give it a proper go it is an absolute tank compared to the switch it feels a bit nicer to hold in the hand but it's heavier and my gosh look at the size of it yeah excited to try this one out but talking about kind of handheld systems and all that I had a bit of a retro gaming kind of itch recently I actually ended up picking up this which is absolutely one of my favorite pickups this is the Miu Mini Plus which is a handheld emulator which kind of does everything up to PS1 but I've been using it to play my old favorite retro games and because it is so small the size of this thing is absolutely tiny I've just been leaving it in my bag and it's kind of become one of my new Ed DC items and it is such a wonderful little system to play I will say though because it is so small and my hands are quite big it's not the best for Long play sessions I can get for about maybe 20 minutes before my hands start to ache which obviously isn't ideal but this isn't the sort of thing I want to sit down and play for ages it's just good for those short bursts and it's been really really cool comes in a bunch of colorways as well but I think this white is just really nice but yeah Miu Mini Plus great little emulator moving on from there is a purchase which I didn't think would become my favorite or at least one of my favorites this year but it turns out it has and that is the Apple airpods pro version 2 I only picked these up because my generation On's just died they started hissing and making all sorts of noises and the battery just went and I didn't think the generation 2 would be that different but they really are these sound so much better the battery life is better I think mine were getting knackered anyway and the form factor of these is a little nicer as well cuz you get a tag in here so you can like attach a lanyard to it or something which isn't something that I personally do but these have been absolutely Fant fantastic these have mag safe now as well which my old ones didn't so I can just attach these to a charger and charge them up on the go they also have much better active noise cancelling than the last ones as well which was awesome because they already good and one of the best things about this version as well is the fact that I can ping them with find mine I often used to lose these all the time and the fact that I can make these kind of shout when I've lost them is awesome so yeah airpods Pro 2 another great thing I've really really loved this year and airpods are one of those things if I lost them or broke them or anything like that is one of the very few products I would buy again instantly because they're just so good sticking with pocket and EDC stuff another thing I really liked this year is this car heart pocket sort of wallet thing I was using a hersel one before which I really liked but this one has a little bit more room and it stays really Compact and Tiny and what I like about it and what I haven't actually done yet is this one's got a small tag on the side so I can actually attach an air tag to it so I don't lose it great wallet the only thing I don't like about it is it doesn't have RF D protection which is a shame but otherwise it's great really like this little wallet okay last thing in my pocket and this is kind of an easy win for the year but the iPhone 15 Pro Max was an awesome upgrade we got the bigger telephoto lens and all that sort of stuff but I'm not really here to talk massively about that I actually think the standard iPhone 15 was the kind of sleeper hit this year because you got the pro level camera from last year so the 48 megapixel main shooter and you got the dynamic Island which is a really cool upgrade for the kind of the standard model did keep the same processor and stuff as last year or was the same as the 14 pro but that's okay it's still a really good processor and it also kept the little silent switch which I think I actually prefer over the action button also the array of colors it came in was just beautiful this green one obviously is my favorite but all of the other colors that came out as well were just awesome if I wasn't doing all this kind of YouTube stuff and all those sorts of things this is probably where I'd put my money if I was due an upgrade moving on from my pockets now to something else which is kind kind of small and that's the iPad Mini now you'll probably know this was released in 2021 I think which is a while ago but I only ever had a demo unit of this I never owned one truly well not for a long time but I picked one up this year and it's actually been probably my favorite iPad this year it's been really good because when we moved into the studio space I didn't have a proper setup for my iPad and I like having my iPad next to my desktop monitor but while I couldn't have that the iPad Mini has really kind of plugged the gap which is really nice and because I was to and from the studio all the time having something this small for note taking and for doing all those other things was just really really useful and it didn't feel like it was taking up any desk space or anything like that I was still getting most of the functions I used too it also reintroduced me to iPad gaming a little bit because I hadn't been doing that in a while but having the form factor on here for a bit of gaming was actually really really nice another piece of tech I've been loving since we got to this studio is the Samsung the frame TV which we've had placed on the wall surrounded by other frames as well and this is only the 10 80P version but it's actually been really really nice it's 32 in as well which isn't massive but we've had it on a lot in the office either watching series or mainly listening to lowii while we get on with work but it's been a great kind of way to just bring the whole studio together because it gives us a central point to focus on while also kind of adding to the overall aesthetic so that's been really great too okay lastly the thing I wanted to talk about is something I can't specifically show you because it's filming me right now and that's the Sony fx3 I picked this up earlier in the year as a second camera body because I've been using the Sony a74 and I've been absolutely loving that camera but if that broke or something happened to it I wouldn't be able to run this channel properly and I knew the Sony fx3 was going to be an investment in the future because it's an incredible camera it does 4K all the way up to 120 frames per second and it's a body which is completely built for video and I thought now that I've moved into the studio it seems like the perfect upgrade to have and it's honestly been fantastic it's got a fan built into it as well so there's no chance of it over Heating and it's something I know I'm not going to be getting rid of for years and years and years I know that it's going to stand a test of time and obviously all of my old lenses fit right on to it it's been a really beautiful camera to use so that rounds up all the tech that I've been loving hating or thinking is just okay this year I hope you enjoyed the video if there's anything that you've been using this year specifically that you think has been awesome or that's been really disappointing let me know in the comments below because I always love to read that sort of thing and of course I will see you all in the next one [Music]
