How_to_get_THE_MOST_from_your_iPad_in_2023___YouTube
 
[Music] foreign over the last year or so I've been using the iPad more than I ever thought I would Apple's continued updates to the device has made it a Powerhouse in some aspects and kind of confusing in others but today I wanted to go over the best accessories tips and tricks my favorite apps and some full experiments but more than anything I just wanted to show you how you can get the most out of your iPad so let's get right into it a good place to start with your iPad is your home screens this is where you see everything so making it work for you is well worth your time something I like to do is to implement different layouts depending on if you're in portrait or landscape mode doing this is really really simple just move your apps and widgets around in that orientation and it will stay whenever you go back into that orientation so you can make a layout for portrait and then one for landscape I'm also a really huge fan of having different home screens using the shortcuts widget this allows me to switch screens with the touch of a button I've got one for productivity I've got one for gaming and I've got one that just brings me home and I've also got one which launches into my favorite Lo-Fi station I made these using Focus modes you can set these up in your settings and then turn them into shortcuts and then you can place them on your home screen I've got a video on how I sorted all of that so I'll link it below but this is one of my favorite things Apple did over last year with the iPad and it's well worth looking at if there's something I've Loved about using the iPad over the last year it's having it in a stand next to my desktop setup and I think if you have an 11 inch iPad or bigger then this is definitely worth giving a go the stand I have here is from charge M Pro it's magnetic so the iPad snapped on and off really easily and it kind of looks like an Apple product too which is great I generally use this so I can have anything I need up on the iPad while I'm working that could be notes my to-do list notion Pinterest or even just YouTube it's been like this really nice productivity boost and it allows me direct access to iPad apps while I'm on my desktop which I really like however if you are iPad only it's also nice to have a stand to pair it with a keyboard and a little mouse or something like that so you're not hunched over it like a laptop all the time which is just going to give you a nicer experience too not to mention while it's sitting next to your monitor if you have a Mac you can use it with universal control which brings me to my next Point basically universal control allows you to control and use your iPad with whatever keyboard or Mouse you're using for your Mac or even vice versa I mainly use it combined with my Mac Studio on my desktop setup and it allows me direct access to my iPad without even lifting a finger I really love it and it's kind of changed how I work in general bringing the iPad into pretty much everything I do it also lets you transfer files between the mac and the iPad seamlessly just by dragging it which is really really cool and actually really useful too my entire desk setup is kind of built around that feature because I love it so much and if you want more details I of course have a video on it so I'll link that below too moving on from there if you are lucky enough to own one of the M1 powered iPads such as the 2022 air model or the M1 Pro or the M2 Pro then you've got access to full external monitor support too and for those of you looking to turn the iPad into a laptop or a desktop replacement you'll likely really enjoy this to get the connection sorted you just need to connect to a monitor via the USBC plug on the iPad while you've got a keyboard and mouse paired to it too then you'll be greeted with a full desktop version of iPad OS which means you can have true multitasking with floating windows in a similar vein to Mac OS or Windows albeit with some caveats the release of this external monitor feature has been pretty spotty though the beta releases of it were quite buggy and really messy and kind of difficult to use and it even got to the point where Apple just delayed the feature outright but it is here now and if you work in research-based areas where you're in the browser a lot or if you're using kind of standard iPad apps to get your work done then you can actually get a really good experience on here there's still a lot to be desired and I don't think a stage manager is quite there yet but this is absolutely worth checking out if you're on one of the higher end iPads if you're looking at speeding up the way you use the iPad then getting to know the OS with some hidden tips and tricks is totally worth it I do have an entire video on this and on pencil tips and tricks too so I'll link that below of course but here's a couple of my favorites that I use every day you can copy and paste much faster by using three fingers on the iPad simply highlight what you want to copy then pinch in with three fingers and then to paste it simply pinch outward with three fingers somewhere else an extra tip here is if you have handoff setup on your iPhone you can pinch outwards on there with three fingers and it will paste too which is really awesome and when I'm using the pencil I'll very often take a screenshot by swiping up from the bottom left which allows you to immediately mark it up if you need to again super useful there's so many hidden things here that Apple does really shout about so be sure to check out my video on all of those on that apple pencil based Note 2 and I've honestly said this before but I think investing in a keyboard and pencil for the iPad is really worthwhile both products can really open up what you do with an iPad if you can Apple's magic keyboard and pencil generally give you the best experience but they are expensive there's no guessing around that but luckily there are other options Logitech makes some really good stuff like the crayon and combo keyboards and there's a million other little keyboard options out there that will give you that more laptop like experience for me the keyboard is perfect when working away from the office it allows me to get a lot more stuff done than the on-screen one ever could and despite not being an artist in the traditional sense the pencil is perfect for sketching taking notes and having finer control over the entire iPad system it's absolutely an investment for sure but I really do think these accessories are worth getting into as if any piece of tech software made specifically for it can really show what it's capable of and trying out some more professional level applications for the iPad is totally worth your time some of my favorites in those areas are Lightroom I use this to edit all of my photography so everything you see on my Instagram everything you see on Twitter and all the places like that has been edited pretty much in the iPad app with the pencil to get a bit of finer control over it I use notion a lot and I know a lot of people don't like notion on the iPad but I still use a huge amount on here it's my go-to app for organizing myself and everything on this entire YouTube channel goodnotes 5 is still my top tier note-taking app but there are a bunch of equally good ones out there procreate is where many things start for me on iPad from from their designs to wallpaper ideas is also one of the best Showcases of the apple pencil if you're into making digital art so that's definitely worth checking out freeform is Apple's new app for iPad which is basically a giant whiteboard that you can vibrate with people on and from what I've used so far it's awesome if you love having a huge never-ending canvas to kind of sketch out ideas and think about things and finally DaVinci Resolve is now on iPad if you're not sure what that is that's a video editor that a lot of professionals and YouTubers here on YouTube used to edit and most importantly color grade their videos and the fact that it's Now on iPad is really promising we just need Apple to bring Final Cut over and then we'll finally be done but these are all really decent apps that are absolutely worth checking out okay I know I've spoken about note taking on the iPad huge amount on this channel so I don't want to keep hammering on about it but if you haven't already I still think this is one of the iPad's strongest areas where it truly shines as a different product completely and if you're not giving it a go you're really missing out my advice would be to start with Apple notes because it's genuinely very good right now and it's free and it's built in but if you're looking at branching out and you need some help navigating which note taking app to dig into then I of course have a fully updated video about all of the best note-taking apps so I'll link that below as well now iPads aren't just for getting work done and productivity based tasks they're also pretty huge for entertainment and I'm sure a lot of you out there probably already use it to watch a bunch of stuff but what I will also say is the iPad is capable of some pretty good gaming experiences now I'm not suggesting this is any kind of replacement for a dedicated console because it's not but the iPad can gain not only is there a big selection of games on the App Store but Apple arcade also has some bangers which I've really enjoyed although I will say it could do some more titles on there for sure some of the games I've enjoyed playing on iPad are cozy Grove Final Fantasy 7 first Soldier what the Cove dead sales hyper light Drifter and sayonara wildhearts amongst a bunch of other stuff I would say though it's definitely worth playing with a controller if you can recently I've been enjoying the 8-Bit do ultimate controller which is fantastic for iPad and switch and mac and windows but if you've got an Xbox controller or a Playstation One kicking around then that will connect no problem and it will give you a much more console-like experience to finish off this video I did want to mention there's no quicker way to go back to using your laptop or your desktop than to kind of force using an iPad for some tasks a laptop or a desktop machine is still better and you should be totally honest with yourself when you hit those walls otherwise you're going to get frustrated or you're just going to put the iPad down and never come back to it over a year ago when I made this video last time I did say that the iPad isn't a laptop and a laptop isn't an iPad and that's still pretty much holding true today even if those lines are getting blurrier and blurrier I think leaning into the iPad's unique accessories and form factor is absolutely the best way to get the most out of it just enjoy the iPad for being an iPad and for someone like me the iPad is still that companion device it's the sort of thing that I use in conjunction with my desktop or it's the sort of thing I can take on lighter days when I know I don't need loads of computing power with me it's the perfect companion for getting smaller things done or for using specific perfectly with the apple pencil for enjoying sketching or taking notes or anything else like that anyway that pretty much rounds up this video and everything I've learned about using the iPad I hope you've really enjoyed it as ever I will link everything I possibly can below so you can go and check all those things out and if you think I'm missing anything then please let me know comments below how you're using the iPad to get work done or just for entertainment purposes I always love to hear what you have to say and as ever I will see you all in the next one thank you
