- A lot of you asked me to compare Google's new Pixel Tablet with the iPad 9, and at first I thought that it wasn't really a fair comparison because the iPad 9 is almost two years old and it's also a lot less expensive, but the more I thought about it I realized that maybe the cheaper tablet is actually better. So let's talk about it, and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring a portion of this video. So first, let's get price out of the way. We're looking at 499 for the Pixel Tablet versus 329 for the iPad 9. These are the official prices in the US, and remember that the iPad starts out with 64 gigabytes of storage, the Pixel Tablet starts out with 128, and both are available with 256 gigs. Now in terms of aesthetics, both tablets have rounded edges but the iPad still has large bezels on the top and the bottom, whereas the Pixel Tablet has smaller bezels all the way around. Build quality is very solid on both devices as they both have an aluminum back and frame, but the Pixel has a really nice nano ceramic coating which I think looks great. Now both tablets do a good job at rejecting fingerprints, the iPad comes in silver and space gray and the Pixel Tablet is available in porcelain, rose and hazel. For biometric authentication both tablets use a fingerprint sensor, with the Pixel Tablet its integrated into the power button and with the iPad 9 we still have the old style home button. Now both work well but I like that the Pixel Tablet doesn't require you to first wake the tablet, just place your finger on the sensor and it will wake and unlock. For charging an accessories, the Pixel Tablet uses a USBC port and the iPad uses a lightning port, so that's a win for the Pixel. Now continuing around the edges we see some important differences when it comes to audio, the iPad has two speakers and they're both at the bottom so if you're watching a movie or if you're playing a game in landscape mode, the audio only comes out to one side. The Pixel Tablet has four speakers, two on each side, so we're getting stereo sound and overall the audio quality is also better. The iPad does have one advantage that's important to a lot of users, and that it still has a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so you can use wired headphones or a wired headset without needing an adapter, and we'll come back to this again in the gaming section. While both tablets have a similar footprint, there's some important differences when it comes to the displays. So both are 60 hertz LCD displays, the pixel is larger it has a higher resolution, higher pixel density, and both displays have a typical peak brightness of 500 NITS. So they should perform about the same when you're outside or when you have to deal with reflections. We are getting different aspect ratios here, the iPad 9 has approximately a four by three aspect ratio versus 16 by 10 on the Pixel Tablet. And when you're watching movies or videos, that image on the Pixel Tablet will fill a bit more of the display, and you'll have smaller black bars at the top and the bottom. Now, of course, if you zoom to fill you're not gonna get letter boxing with either one, but you'll lose less of the left and the right sides of the image with the Pixel Tablet. Now another important difference is the way the displays are constructed. So the Pixel Tablet has a fully laminated display, meaning that the display, the touch layer, and the cover glass, are fused together into a single display assembly. The iPad 9 has an air gap between the display and the combination of cover glass and touch layer. For most things like watching movies, surfing the web, or playing games, it's not really something that you're going to notice unless you really look for it but once you start using a stylus on the iPad 9, you can see separation between the tip of the pencil and the content that's being created, especially if you're looking at an angle. On the Pixel Tablet the image looks like it's painted right on top of the glass and the tip of the stylus looks like it's touching the content that's being created. And speaking of the different stylus options, the iPad 9 is compatible with the first generation Apple pencil, which costs 100 bucks. The Pixel Tablet is compatible with USI 2.0 stylus pens and the one that I chose cost me around 60 bucks. I always mention that I'm not an artist but I do have a lot of friends who are illustrators, and they love the Apple Pencil. It's challenging for me to pick a winner here because there's no standards stylus for the Pixel Tablet so it really could depend on which one you get, and for what I do, which is just handwriting some notes and sketching a little bit, there isn't really a major difference between the two. But looking at keyboard cases, right now there's no official keyboard case from Google and hopefully there'll be some third-party options available very soon. For the iPad 9, Apple makes the smart keyboard which I don't really like, I don't love that design, and I actually prefer the Logitech Slim Folio and Combo Touch. But what if you want a budget friendly tablet with premium build quality and expandable internal storage? That brings me to today's sponsor, Best Buy, and the Amazon Fire Max 11. It's Amazon's biggest and most powerful tablet yet, and it's designed to keep you entertained, connected, and productive. The Fire Max 11 comes with stereo speakers and 11 inch LCD display with an aspect ratio of five by three, so it's great for watching movies. It has an octa-core processor and either 64 or 128 gigabytes of internal storage, and both models come with four gigabytes of ram. We're getting an eight megabyte rear facing camera and an eight megabyte front facing camera located on the long edge, which makes it great for video calls. If you wanna get more out of your fire max 11, you can pick up a compatible stylus. There's also a dedicated keyboard case with a track pad, a row of function keys, and there is no need to charge the case because it connects to the tablet using pogo pins. You can also use the micro SD card slot to inexpensively add up to one terabyte of internal storage, and that way you can have plenty of space for the files, apps, and games that you want. So if you're ready to try out Amazon's biggest and most powerful tablet, check out the Fire Max 11 at Best Buy, and thank you to Best Buy for sponsoring this portion of the video. Now, when we compare the prices and accessories of the Pixel Tablet and the iPad 9, it's important to mention that the Pixel Tablet comes with a charging speaker doc. This accessory sells for $128, if you were to buy it separately. It charges the Pixel Tablet wirelessly, it raises it off your desk so it's at a great viewing angle, and it acts as a speaker when the tablet is docked so you're getting even better audio performance. It can also replace a Nest Hub Max, if that's something that you're considering getting. Now there are definitely some opportunities for improvement with this doc, like, for example, Google could have made the speaker wifi or Bluetooth enabled, so you could use it with your phone or when the Pixel Tablet is not docked. Could've also made the sound quality a little bit better for the price but, in any case, it's something that you don't get with the iPad 9 so it's definitely part of the equation. Now moving on to the camera systems, both tablets have an eight megapixel rear facing camera. The Pixel Tablet comes with an eight megapixel front facing camera and the iPad 9 comes with a 12 megapixel front facing camera. I like the position of the Pixel Tablet camera better because it's on the long edge so you're always properly framed, and here's a quick sample. Here's a test of the camera and microphone on the Pixel Tablet and the iPad 9. This should give you a pretty good idea of the type of image quality that you're going to get, and the type of audio quality that you should expect from each tablet. Now moving on to processing power, the iPad 9 is powered by the A13 Bionic and it has three gigabytes of ram. The Pixel Tablet uses the Tensor G2 chip and it comes with eight gigs of ram. So let's quickly look at benchmarks and then move on to real-life use. So the older iPad 9 actually outscores the Pixel Tablet for single and multi-core performance, it also comes out ahead when we look at GPU performance, but that's just benchmarks what about actual real-life use? So for the vast majority of things, I haven't really noticed a major difference. Both tablets are responsive, the apps open quickly, and then switching between apps and multitasking works really well. Now I always mention that all things being equal, I opt for the more powerful machine because apps are going to evolve, they're gonna require more and more resources over time, so I'd rather have as much headroom as possible in terms of CPU and GPU performance. Another important factor is OS and security updates, which have always been a huge strength of the iPad. And with the Pixel Tablet, Google Promises Android updates until at least June of 2026, and security updates until June of 2028. Now looking at battery life both have been very good for me, the iPad is rated for 10 hours, the Pixel Tablet is rated for 12 hours, and based on my tests of the Pixel Tablet now and then the iPad 9 when I got it and it was brand new, I'm gonna give this slight edge to the iPad. When it comes to multitasking, obviously we're looking at entry to mid-tier tablets here so I think it's important that we have reasonable expectations. With both tablets you can use two apps side by side, both have a UI doc that you can use to quickly switch between apps, but the iPad has more advanced features like popup and slide over windows. Now both tablets allow you to share files with nearby devices, but the iPad can be used as an external display for your Mac or MacBook using Apple's Sidecar. And you can learn more about this great feature right here, if you're interested. What the Pixel Tablet has going for it is Hub Mode, so when the tablet is docked this essentially turns it into a smart hub, and an even more important advantage is the ability to create multiple users. So in a typical household, you may want more than one person to use the same tablet, but at the same time you don't really want them to have access to all your files, information, and all of your apps. So with the Pixel Tablet you can set up multiple users, and each one will get their own apps. And by the way, if two users install the same app, Android only installs one version so you're not using up double the storage. Now speaking of apps in general, this is an area where the iPad still comes out ahead. The Google Play Store and the Apple App Store have plenty of options for pretty much everything that you need, but overall I'm still going to give the edge to the iPad 9 because the apps seem to be better optimized for a tablet. Now I've said this in other videos as well, that gap continues to shrink but a lot of Android apps still look like stretched out versions of the phone apps. Now, several creative apps like Affinity Photo, DaVinci Resolve, and Procreate are only available for the iPad, but it's great to see that there's an Android version of LumaFusion in the Play Store. Now when we look at gaming, in most cases the games themselves worked really well with both tablets. I was able to use the same settings in "PUBG", so HDR for graphics with Extreme for Frame rate or Ultra HD for graphics with Ultra for frame rate. "Asphalt 9", which is always super fun to play, worked great. The graphics looked terrific on both devices and gameplay was smooth, and even more demanding games like "Genshin Impact" were playable on both devices. And, as I mentioned, this is an area where I appreciate having the additional CPU and GPU performance on the iPad. For gaming audio, if you play without headphones, then there's no question that the Pixel Tablet with four speakers is the better choice. You're getting audio from both sides, it sounds better, and it's easier to detect where sounds are coming from. Now most of the time I'm wearing headphones, so it comes down to what you use. If you're using wireless headphones then both of these are gonna work great, but if you want wired headphones, I'm gonna give the edge to the iPad 9 because, as I mentioned, it still has a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and the port is located out of the way. Both tablets also work really well for streaming games, so, for example, with the Xbox Game Pass app you can just pair an Xbox controller and then play any of the available games. I'm going to give the edge to the Pixel Tablet here because it has a larger display and everything looks slightly bigger. So having said all that, how should you choose? The Pixel Tablet has a larger, higher resolution and fully laminated display, it comes with a charging speaker doc which can double as a smart hub, it has better speakers, it comes with twice the internal storage so you have more room for the files, apps, and games that you want, and you're able to have multiple users. The iPad 9 is a lot less expensive, it has a more powerful chip, a higher resolution selfie camera, optional keyboard cases, it comes with a headphone jack, and there are models with cellular connectivity.
