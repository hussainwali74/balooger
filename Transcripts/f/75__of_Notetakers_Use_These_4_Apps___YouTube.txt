75__of_Notetakers_Use_These_4_Apps___YouTube
 
we asked 6 519 people what notes app they use you need to have an app that works for your personality and your practices otherwise you just won't use it but the reality for most people is there's another even more pressing question what note-taking app is everyone else using [Music] first let's look at our oldest data from august 2020 we had only 10 options for this survey first place out of those 10 we have evernote which took 38 of all the votes second place was notion representing 23 of the students surveyed third place was rome research coming up with eleven percent another nine percent of students said that they hadn't picked a note-taking app yet next we had one note at seven percent google docs with four percent and another four percent of students claiming other which makes sense as we only had ten choices for this survey finally three percent reported apple notes two percent emacs and one percent bear the clear takeaway here is that together notion and evernote make up a full sixty percent of the note-taking tools on their own our second survey was much more comprehensive this was a massive cohort and we surveyed a full 2 800 plus students about their note-taking app of choice this survey and the next both include returning students to building a second brain so it reflects people who have been deeply studying notetaking for a while as well as complete newbies in first place evernote had 30 percent of all students notion came in second place with 19 third was rome increasing to 18 of students surveyed up quite a bit from the previous sample fourth was newcomer obsidian with seven percent then other with six percent of students surveyed five percent for apple notes four percent for one note four percent for none two percent for google docs and then one percent each for devon think bear microsoft word emacs and dropbox paper by early 2021 we can see a very clear big three evernote sits at number one with notion in rome vying for second place that's 70 total combined across those three apps let's dig into the big three for a second first is evernote it's the og note-taking app and at one point had 220 million reported users that is absolutely insane evernote is perfect for the librarian note-taking style i talked about all of these archetypes in my last video part one of the series second let's talk about notion notion has been around since 2016 and is great for teams and for personal dashboards third rome research was the new kid on the block when the survey was conducted and it was the most prominent example of the new graph based or networked notes paradigm so it makes sense that it has such a strong showing here let's move on to our third survey this was from building a second brain's 13th cohort we surveyed over 1300 new and returning students in first place yet again evernote with 31 of all students in second place was notion with 20 of students holding strong rome on the other hand still held on to third place but dropped slightly to 15 percent of students while obsidian scooted up the charts a bit to 10 of students up from its previous seven percent these four combined account for over 75 percent of the total note-taking population for our 13th cohort next we have students who claimed other apple notes and onenote at about five percent of the total for each of those options finally holding between point one percent and three percent we have google docs bear devon think word google keep emacs and dropbox paper so this is very interesting because while the big three still exists and they're holding on to their spots notion in evernote increased slightly while rome fell a good percentage and obsidian rose a good amount in fact rome fell the exact percentage that obsidian rose one interpretation of this data is that the big three are actually evernote with 31 notion with 20 and networked notes of rome plus obsidian representing a combined 25 with three note-taking styles representing roughly even portions of the population okay let's take a look at our most recent data i recently taught a three-hour workshop for anyone who pre-ordered my upcoming book while this is our smallest group size it's also the group that's most likely to be new to digital notetaking here's what the results look like for that poll first place in a major upset we have notion with 28 of those polled in second place we have evernote at 22 then in third place we have obsidian with 16 percent of total respondents next we have those who respond to none at seven percent one note at six percent and rome at five percent our remaining votes were for apple notes at three percent craft a two percent and log sec at one percent first of all this is the first time i've seen a majority of second brain participants claiming notion as their second brain app that's a fascinating development and it probably reflects the momentum around notion as a company second this is our second data point showing obsidian's rise and stunningly rome isn't anywhere close to the top three in this small sample at only five percent of those surveyed this suggests that obsidian and rome might not necessarily share the same user base and that obsidian represents a much larger segment of newer faces to note-taking apps additionally two newcomers to the network to note space craft and logsec make up a meaningful showing here for the first time if you're looking to just maximize the practical utility of your notes evernote is the dominant app by user count still if you are an architect and love to structure your information notion is a great pick with a lot of passionate users third if you're more of a gardener and you're interested in self-discovery and learning rome and obsidian are the two clear incumbents in the space with obsidian appearing to currently be on pace to grow the faster of the two but if you're feeling like playing with some of the new entrants to the space check out kraft and logsec which are the up and comers for the gardener archetype finally if all of these sound too complicated onenote and apple notes have strong loyal contingents they aren't the headliners but you know what they get the job done for the student archetype in the next video of this series i'll be taking the notes apps that we discussed in this video and doing a quick dive into the specific features and characteristics that set each one apart thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video [Music]
