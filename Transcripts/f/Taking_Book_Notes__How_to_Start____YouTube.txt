Taking_Book_Notes__How_to_Start____YouTube
 
this is a book a technology where you can't search the text exporting highlights is painful and your note-taking space is limited but sometimes reading an actual book simply can't be beat in this video we'll show you the easiest way to create a second brain that lives right on your bookshelf are you guys seeing this this is incredible a technique taught to us by book reading influencer Alex in books who used this system to read hundreds of books a year and build an audience of over six hundred thousand book reading fans Alex's first step is capture as I read the book you want to highlight the important information if something really resonates with you sticks out you want to capture that if you open up the front few pages of the book you have the table of contents but what you want to do as a reader is create your own table of contents so as I read the book and I find something interesting not only will I highlight it I'll go back to like the front cover of the book and then I'll write down the page number and why I found that interesting page 19 how you explain what common book is page 40 like three steps of product management system page 43 of the code framework the more impactful the book is more life-changing it is the more notes you're going to want to take on it because your brain would just be screaming at you like hey this is important write this down write this down as I'm reading the book I'm taking down the lessons and then organizing those lessons you have your own custom table of contents essentially inside of the cover which is like you said the subjects the ideas the observations that you found most impactful and a page number if I highlight something and I find it like really important I'll put a star next to it and then I'll add it to like the table of contents so it has like the star at the end so I know it's like not just important but like super important the book becomes the notes themselves oh what was that really great quote you open up the front cover you kind of just skim your table of contents it's like oh yeah that quote was on page 77 let me flip through it and there it is as I finish the book next up would be to distill the information so I go to the back cover and on the back left hand side I'm distilling the most important lessons I've learned from the book in your own words do you write them yep brilliant perfect maybe like it's been a few months since you built your second brain you want to refresh pressure memory you just go to the back cover and you're like okay what lessons did I find important or what did I want to apply that I haven't yet applied the last step in the framework is to express I try to take the lessons I've learned and try to figure out how I could turn them into actionable device on the inside of the back cover you have your expression your interpretation which is how you're going to apply those lessons exactly and then what I also do on the front cover I write down the day I start a book and on the back cover I write the day I finished it and then I could see like how that kind of changed the trajectory of my life you can either look just at those few pages which are kind of a snapshot of who you were and what you found valuable at that time or you could reread it perhaps jumping around based on your custom table of contents even see it in a different line Come Away with different lessons when do you do this as you're reading do you stop and then go add something to the table of contents and something to the lessons or do you like batch it into stages as I'm reading it I'll wait till I finish the page before I start highlighting because otherwise I kind of find everything interesting it is kind of a balance because if I go to write it it kind of breaks the flow of the reading so what I'll often do is I'll dog here Mark the page or I'll just like put a star next to it that's super important and then once I finish the chapter that'll take like a few minutes to like just write it down quickly and I'll go back to the reading process it might depend on the book too right like some books that are intellectually dense if you stop dissolves right other books are almost like each paragraph is just one idea very simple and you can almost stop anywhere and just keep going the next time so there's probably like a calibration depending on the subject how and when does that make the jump into digital what is the bridge between the paper world and the digital world usually after like I finish a book my one wait a few days just to like kind of cool off and then kind of go back to it and revisit the back cover where it's like the lessons and actionable device if you read a book like Atomic habits you can't just apply 20 habits at once so yeah I just came up with like a rule of three let me just find like three lessons and three pieces of actionable advice and that's kind of like my goal with every book I read let me just get three and three usually I write the newsletter like every Thursday or Friday open up a new email doc I'll look at my book notes and try to think okay what are like the three biggest takeaways I had from this book share like a few sentences about it once I'm done with that is trying to figure out okay now that they know these lessons how could you possibly apply them or how could you take this information turn into knowledge once the newsletter goes out then I usually copy and paste it and then upload it to like notion from the moment you read the book I bet part of your brain is thinking about the newsletter the audience what they're gonna think what they're gonna expect right so it's like you have a reason to keep going in like a like a filter for things it takes serious time effort energy you have to say no to things to say yes to books it's a really cool point to like build an accountability to your life and not just assume you're gonna on a regular basis decide oh I'm gonna write I'm gonna read a book now I love that team first questions like what would this look like if it was easy and you talk about this in your books like you never want to start with a blank page so if I read this book and I take notes on it I have those notes I'm not starting with a blank page so this newsletter Echo writing like less than an hour like the whole thing so the structure of the newsletter mirrors the structure of the steps of your note-taking process lesson since actionable advice yeah it's not like you're having to do a lot of like re reorganizing exactly so recently um been trying to figure out how can I digitalize my notes to kind of make it easier to find easier to search and just bring up old notes or old books that I haven't like touched in a while I do want to write a book one day it makes sense to digitalize my notes make it easier to find I just keep like a simple notion dock where I have like the bug title the author the reading progress if I finish the book or how the note-taking process is going the rating of the book what genre the book ball is in what made you choose notion for this one is like a free software two is pretty easy to use I'll use Apple notes but then usually I'll graduate to another system once you hit like the ceiling and the system breaks like for Twitter I'm not going to write Twitter threads in my notes app because I can't see the format of it so then I move that to typefully the nosap is like the high school of where you want to keep your nose and then if they graduate then you move them to like a certain college or specific app or a certain area of that so you want the nosap as your foundation and then once the system breaks or you can't handle it or you need more features then you go to the next app but for now just stick to the basics of the works and then if you need something better there's always an option out there oh my gosh I love this point and I'll talk to people oh yeah I want to write a book one day what is the ultimate book writing platform oh I want to make a video what is the best most powerful video editing software used by Hollywood Studios Hollywood editors they worked up to that they started I think usually with informal general purpose tools that are not highly specialized and then as you actually hit the ceiling only then do you move to the next solution and even then you just go to the minimal next stage it's like you are from high school college then your Masters then your PhD you don't go from high school PhD if it's too complex if it's too fancy you're never going to use it that's the way I look at it which app or like technique am I more likely to use and if it works that's the one I'm sticking with Simplicity over complex to learn more about how to incorporate digital and physical notes together watch this video next
