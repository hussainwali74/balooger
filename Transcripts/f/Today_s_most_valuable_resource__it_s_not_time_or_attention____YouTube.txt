for most of human history the most scarce resource was space we fought Wars for land and the natural resources it contained Empires and Nations fought for every inch of territory and scoured the planet in search of material wealth as industrialization spread the biggest most influential companies were the ones that harvested physical resources oil steel railroads and Manufacturing were the defining industries of the time the mindset of this era was one of Zero Sum competition there were only so many resources only so much wealth if you wanted more you had to take it from someone but at some point in the 20th century things changed we ran ran out of space there was no more land no more continents to claim as the world started moving faster and faster the source of economic value shifted to time time became the most scarce resource and thus the most valuable the space era gave way to the time era after World War II we saw the rise of a sizable middle class they had disposable income but limited time outside of their professional careers a new generation of Industries arose to capitalize on the scarcity of time mass media Consumer Finance advertising television these industries gave us ways to fill every minute of the day with consumption the idea that time is money became widespread because time could now be translated directly into economic output but the same thing happened once again we ran out of time there they were only 24 hours in a day as companies started competing for people's attention the source of economic value shifted once more the time era gave way to the attention era the attention era was fueled by the rise of technology and the internet human attention became the most valuable resource on the planet a new wave of companies and industries began to capitalize on the value of our attention we saw the rise of a creative class the creative class emerged because people's attention can't be captured just once it has to be captured again and again and again this Demands a constant creative output new content new products new ads New messaging in the attention era economic value is measured in eyeballs how many eyeballs do you have on your product or your website or your app eyeballs are so valuable that a company can be losing money quarter after quarter even year after year yet still be worth billions of dollars how can that be it's because our eyeballs are the product our attention is what's for sale we've spent most of our lives in the attention era but again the same thing is happening we've run out of attention there isn't any left every minute of the day is spent on our devices on social media listening to podcasts even in the briefest windows of time do you feel it the constant pressure to consume information 24/7 that feeling that you have to make use of every single minute the fear that there is always something better you could be doing with your time these are signs that the attention era is coming to a close the attention era is giving way to the perspective [Music] era today the most scarce resource and thus the most valuable is perspective perspective is having a point of view an opinion about what matters and what doesn't perspective means holistic understanding being able to see the full picture instead of getting caught up in tiny details perspective includes wisdom an awareness of our own emotions and values we have this constant feeling of information overload of being flooded with information what do people do in a flood they seek The High Ground a hill to stand on that will allow them to rest get their bearings and make a plan finding High Ground allows us to gain the perspective to step back and make sense of what is happening to us this means taking on a leadership position in our own lives it is up to you to think about your mission your strategy and your desired future as futurist Paul safo says point of view is that quintessentially human solution to information overload in a world of hyper abundant content point of view will become the scarcest of resources so many of the changes rocking our world can be traced to one shift we've moved from a world of information scarcity to a world of information abundance for all of human history information was incredibly scarce knowledge was trapped in human Minds books were rare and expensive but over just the last few decades the internet has changed all of that the cost of sharing information has dropped to zero the trickle became a fire host now everyone with a computer or a smartphone has access to the collective sum of human knowledge now that sounds great except for one thing our psychology did not evolve for abundance we evolved to prize every bit of information to seek it out to Crave it to hoard it to jealously guard it in the distant past the slightest noise could signal a dangerous animal or an approaching enemy tribe but these instincts are no longer serving us our minds still react to every notification and update like it's a tiger about to pounce on us in the jungle we went so quickly from scarcity to abundance that we're perpetually exhausted now let's take a look at how this plays out in your life each and every day you are hit with a staggering amount of information emails texts calendar invites status updates notifications not to mention all the Articles and books you actually want to read you probably spent a majority of your waking hours consuming content it no longer works to scatter our attention across a random assortment of different apps reacting to the demands of whatever is most urgent your most valuable knowledge is getting lost who knows where we're going to create a system and a set of habits for reliably turning all that information into concrete results in your work and your life a second brain doesn't require you to do everything completely differently it's about being a little more intentional and a little more systematic with how you take notes and organize your Digital Life I'm talking about small changes to the way read books listen to podcasts and take notes on what you learn these are small habits that can have a tremendous impact on the trajectory of your entire life the key to your second brain is the code methodology the letters of code stand for the four essential steps of the creative process capture organize distill and express I've spent years studying history art and creativity the outputs of creativity change over time but the creative process is timeless and unchanging every single writer engineer entrepreneur or artist of the past needed a way to do these four things to capture write things down so they didn't forget them organize sort their material so they could access it later distill break down their ideas to their Essence and to express synthesize their work and share it with the world the purpose of this entire process is to express yourself we all have a need to create to bring something good true or beautiful into the world to close the gap between our vision and our reality these fundamental Creative Steps are more important than ever today we are following the same Timeless creative process but for modern work using modern technology first you use capture tools to save bits of insight and inspiration and your own ideas so they can be preserved forever in the books you read the conversations you have and your daily experiences there's a constant stream of interesting observations that can be used as as creative fuel as your collection of notes grows you organize them to enhance your productivity and reach the goals that are important to you your notes are meant for taking action and you can organize them so that it's easier to make consistent progress on your projects when you're ready to use your notes you distill them down to their most essential succinct form highlighting the best metaphors facts quotes and research gives you this reserve of raw material that you can draw on at a moment's notice and finally you can take advantage of technology and the internet to express your point of view and share your work with the world the second brain code is a framework for making sense of the dizzying array of tips tools and techniques for personal Knowledge Management it is the backbone of everything you'll be learning and a road map to help you navigate the perspective ERA this world of information abundance is like a tidal wave washing over us we have two choices be swept away by that wave or learn how to surf it you can learn to surf at the edge of information abundance you can rise above the chaos and the noise you can see the world from A New Perspective that is uniquely your own we have the code now it's time to use [Music] it
