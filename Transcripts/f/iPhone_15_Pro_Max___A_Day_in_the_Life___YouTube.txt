iPhone_15_Pro_Max___A_Day_in_the_Life___YouTube
 
since owning the iPhone 15 Pro Max I realized I haven't actually spent a proper day testing it out I've just been using it as my phone so today I actually wanted to go and test out the camera properly to test out what it's like for photography check out that new five time zoom lens and also to look at the video log features which are really interesting for creators like me I've also got a bunch of other stuff to do today back at koku Studio we're launching a new product I've got a bunch of Photography to do and I've got lots of website updates to do as well so I'm going to bring you with me on all of that so let's get right into it to start the day we actually decided to head out early to a really Scenic Point in where I live I go to cities a lot but I actually sometimes forget that I live in a really nice area so I met up with my fellow Creator friend Lauren and we headed out to the coast we spent quite a long time walking but on the way we got a bunch of really nice photos and a bunch of video in the new log profile mode for the iPhone 15 as well and honestly it just came out really nicely I've liked what the iPhone produces since the iPhone 13 in terms of like Pro Ro photos especially with the iPhone 14 it did a really good job with that but the iPhone 15 is just kind of that and better so having the new five time zoom is really awesome it doesn't look quite as nice as the standard camera I don't know if the quality is quite there from the five time zoom but it allows you to get some shots which you couldn't get before and when you go out to a coastal area like this some of those can be really really effective and the pro Roar files on the iPhone always just come out really nice they do always look best if you spend a bit of time editing them in like room which is something I always do on all of my photos anyway and I'll link my preset pack below if you want to check it out but that's how I've edited all of these photos and in a very similar way to last year's iPhone 14 I was just really happy with how these looked what I was really impressed with though was the log footage and shooting in log isn't something I normally do especially not on an iPhone and I honestly rarely use it for these videos either I only use it if I really feel like I need it or the situation calls for it but the fact that it can do this is incredible and some of the footage I got out of the iPhone today was so awesome I ended up using the Blackmagic camera app for this which is free which gives you a little bit more control over the camera and everything and it just turned out really nice the only thing I will say though is you need to expose it correctly with log it's a very different kind of thing to work with and I didn't expose all of these correctly so you can see some noise in the highlights and shadows but if you get it right it can look really really awesome frustratingly this shot of a coffee cup is probably the nicest of the entire day and it wasn't even when we were out and about but I Expos this one a lot better we stuck around taking photos and video until around 12:00 and then we decided to head back to a local coffee place because it' been a pretty early start and we were getting pretty hungry and also I just wanted another excuse to sit down and to edit some of the photos in the Lightroom to see the sort of results it was producing after coffee it's about 1:00 so we decide to head back we drop off Lauren on the way and say goodbye to her and then we decided to catch up with Rachel back at kuruku Studio before we carry on I wanted to talk about today's sponsor the soundcore Aero fit Pro the Aero fit Pro are a pair of wireless headphones with a focus on maximum Comfort while remaining snug and secure for all of your outdoor or gym based activities they use a non-intrusive design that pretty much just sits on your ears which makes it much more comfortable when moving around or working out it also allows them to use air conduction technology to deliver a richer audio experience is an ear hook based design made with an aerospace gray titanium wire for toughness meaning they can stretch and bend thousands and thousands of times to sure you get the fit just right for your ears there's a detachable and adjustable neck band too which guarantees total stability even during your most intense workouts they're also ipx5 water resistant and they feature fast charging so 10 minutes will give you a whopping 5.5 hours of listening time and the sound is really decent too I've always thought sound core punches above its weight when it comes to audio quality and these are no different there's 16.2 mm oversized drivers in here which are directed specifically into your ears to provide the best sound while minimizing all leakage so if you want to check out the aoit pro from soundcore follow the link in the description below it's actually quite exciting at kro Studio at the moment we recently P our new wallpaper pack which we're really happy with and if you've picked up already there a huge thank you for that but we're finally releasing another physical product and a lot of this is thanks to the new laser machine that we're borrowing off somebody but it's actually allowed us to make something we've wanted to make for quite a while I get asked quite often in these videos and especially on Instagram what coaster am I using for my mug and rather than direct you somewhere else we actually decided to make it ourselves so this is our new product this is our kind of koku Studio coaster if you will and Rachel's designed something really nice which sits on the side which has been lasered into each and every single one and everyone's a little bit different as well which is really nice so you'll get a kind of bespoke version of it if you do end up buying one while I was in the studio as well I actually has to take a bunch of photos for the release of these as well so I'll spend another couple hours getting those right setting up up a nice scene and taking a bunch of photos which Rachel can use to put on the website these should be available by the time this video is out so if you want to check them out I'll obviously link them below for the rest of the time at the studio for the day I actually spend a lot of time just looking at all the photos and mostly that log footage and seeing a lot of this footage on the big screen was actually really really nice and it kind of showed me that the iPhone can quite easily fit into a regular camera workflow especially for professionals I think this is going to be a really nice feature this is also where one of the new features for the iPhone 15 comes in having that USBC just makes the whole process of transferring footage to an SSD really really simple usually on the previous iPhones you'd have to airdrop stuff to a computer or to upload it somewhere and if you're dealing with really large files like this that can take a really long time but having an SSD and USBC means I could transfer all of the footage from the Blackmagic camera app directly to there and then put it straight into my Mac which is just so much more useful I left the studio around five and headed back back home in the car I don't usually drive to the studio because it's really close but because I came to the studio straight from the location I just had the car with me generally speaking when I get home my iPhone usage kind of goes down quite a lot I'll use it for browsing some socials and sometimes I'll post a little bit as well but usually I use it in a more functional sense so when I'm cooking I'll use it for the homepod to control some music or using it for working out or just for talking to my friends later on I'm actually spending most of my evenings at the moment playing games which is something I always love to make time for right now that's Spider-Man on PS5 which I'm really really enjoying despite some weird bugs and the other one is of course Super Mario wonder which is on switch which is honestly a truly wonderful game it's so surprising and anything you think you know about Mario you can basically rewrite of this game because every time you go into a new level something crazy happens and it's just so much fun to play through I also finished as Elder tear of the Kingdom recently which has been a huge one so playing a game like Mario Wonder has actually been a nice kind of refreshing relaxing experience I usually play games will chill out until around half 10 11: and then I go to bed but there's no point really showing that I did end up losing track of the battery percentage which I thought I was going to check throughout the entire day but just know that when I did go to bed I checked it and we're on about 36% of battery left which is pretty decent for the entire day I had been using it a lot in the morning to take loads of photos and video but after then it kind of returned to normal use and that kind of brings me to My overall thoughts on the iPhone 15 Pro Max I really really like this phone it's not a huge upgrade from the iPhone 14 pro Max I wouldn't suggest you should jump up from a 13 or a 14 probably but if you need those new Pro features it's actually been really good and something which I haven't mentioned is the action button and I've actually just been using this as a silencer more than anything I actually quite like using the button just for that however I did try some shortcuts with it and having a shortcuts menu pop up which has been relatively useful but since trying that I've actually just turned it back to that silent button for me that's always been the most important thing on an iPhone even if I usually put it on silent and just leave it there but that's how I'm using this one as well but otherwise the iPhone 15 has held up in every other area the battery life is great the screen is great and the bezel are a little bit smaller and the cameras as you can tell have been really really awesome it's kind of everything you could want in a phone right now and if you're in the Apple ecosystem like me and you want the latest and greatest there's obviously nowhere else to turn it's a really great phone I don't think anyone would really be disappointed with it so that wraps up this St life I hope you enjoyed it if you've been using your iPhone 15 Pro Max for any kind of camera stuff or if you've been using it in a professional workflow I would love to know so let me know in the comments below and I will see you all in the next [Music] one
